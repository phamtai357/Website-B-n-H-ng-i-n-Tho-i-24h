Geriatric Use Elderly patients aged 65 years or older may have increased sensitivity to Butorphanol tartrate, <i>butorphanol 10mg dogs</i>.</p><h2>Butorphanol For Veterinary Use – Torbutrol</h2><p>In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency butorphanol decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.</p>
<p>Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, butorphanol 10mg dogs, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration.</p>
<p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the <i>dog,</i> and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be 10mg in patients with impaired renal function.</p><img src="https://sep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-12533177228474/torbugesic-injectable-c-iv-10-mg-ml-50-ml-zoetis-00856203320-24.gif" alt="butorphanol 10mg dogs" title="butorphanol 10mg dogs" style="padding: 20px 30px 20px 30px; border: 0px;" width="373" height="255" align="left" ><p>Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dog selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. In nearly all cases the type and incidence of side effects with Butorphanol were those commonly observed with opioid analgesics.</p>
<p>10mg adverse experiences described below 10mg based on data from short- and 10mg clinical trials in patients receiving Butorphanol Tartrate Injection. Body as a Butorphanol Cough, butorphanol 10mg dogs, Dyspnea Skin and Appendages: Sweating, Pruritus Special Senses: They are being listed as alerting information for the physician due to their clinical significance: Chest Pain, Hypertension, Tachycardia Nervous: Shallow Breathing Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Butorphanol Tartrate Injection.</p>
<p><b>Butorphanol</b> these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not butorphanol possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs.</p>
<p>Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients butorphanol in Butorphanol Tartrate Injection.</p>
<p>Abuse Butorphanol Tartrate Injection contains Butorphanol, <b>butorphanol 10mg dogs</b>, a substance with a high potential for dog similar to other opioids including fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, butorphanol 10mg dogs, and tapentadol, butorphanol 10mg dogs.</p>
<p>All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for dogs of abuse and addiction, since use of opioid analgesic products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use.</p>
<p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a prescription drug, even once, <i>butorphanol 10mg dogs</i>, for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects.</p>
<p>Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena <b>butorphanol</b> develop after repeated substance use and includes: Drug-seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours, refusal to undergo appropriate examination, testing, or referral, repeated "loss" of prescriptions, tampering with <i>10mg</i> and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider s.</p>
<p>Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control. Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance. Health care providers 10mg be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts. In addition, abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction. Butorphanol tartrate, like other opioids, can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels of distribution.</p>
<p>Careful record-keeping of prescribing information, <i>butorphanol 10mg dogs</i>, including quantity, frequency, and renewal requests, as required by state and federal law, is strongly advised. Proper assessment of the patient, butorphanol 10mg dogs, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate <i>dogs</i> that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs, <b>butorphanol 10mg dogs</b>.</p>
<p>The risk is increased with concurrent abuse of Butorphanol Tartrate Injection <b>10mg</b> alcohol and other butorphanol nervous system depressants.</p>

Tolerance may occur to both the desired and undesired effects of drugs, and may develop at different rates for different effects.</p>
<p>Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dosage reduction of a drug.</p><h2>What Is Torbutrol for Dogs?</h2><p>Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist butorphanol e. Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days <i>10mg</i> weeks of continued opioid usage.</p>
<p>If Butorphanol tartrate is abruptly discontinued in a physically-dependent patient, a withdrawal syndrome may occur, <i>butorphanol 10mg dogs</i>.

The opioid antagonist, butorphanol 10mg dogs, naloxone or nalmefene, are specific antidotes to respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose.</p><h2>Butorphanol Tartrate (Torbugesic®, Torbutrol®, Dolorex®) for Dogs and Cats</h2><p>For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to Butorphanol tartrate overdose, butorphanol 10mg dogs, administer an opioid antagonist. Opioid antagonists should not be administered in the <i>dog</i> of clinically dog respiratory <b>10mg</b> circulatory depression butorphanol to Butorphanol tartrate overdose, <i>butorphanol 10mg dogs</i>.</p>
<p>Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of Butorphanol in Butorphanol Tartrate Injection, carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably re-established.</p>
<p>If the dog to an opioid antagonist 10mg suboptimal or only brief in nature, administer additional antagonist as directed by the product's <b>10mg</b> <b>dog.</b> In an individual physically dependent on opioids, administration of the recommended usual dosage of the antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal syndrome. The severity of the withdrawal symptoms experienced will depend on the degree of physical dependence and the dose of the antagonist administered.</p>
<p>If a decision is made to treat serious respiratory depression in the physically dependent patient, administration of the antagonist should be begun with care and by butorphanol with smaller than usual doses of the antagonist.</p>
<p>Initiate the dosing regimen for each dog individually, butorphanol 10mg dogs, taking into account <b>butorphanol</b> patient's severity of pain, patient response, butorphanol 10mg dogs, prior analgesic treatment experience, <b>butorphanol 10mg dogs</b>, and risk factors for dog, abuse, and 10mg see WARNINGS.
