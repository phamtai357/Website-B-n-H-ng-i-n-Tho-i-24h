				<p>Studies of abuse potential in former drug abusers found that the 6.25mg of single doses of an immediate-release formulation of zolpidem tartrate 40 mg were similar, but not identical, to diazepam 20 mg, while zolpidem tartrate 10 mg was difficult to distinguish from placebo, <i>zolpidem er 6.25mg tablets</i>. In postmarketing reports of overdose with immediate-release zolpidem tartrate alone, impairment of consciousness has ranged from somnolence <b>zolpidem</b> light coma.</p>
<p>There was one case each of cardiovascular and respiratory compromise. Individuals have fully recovered from zolpidem tartrate overdoses up to mg 40 times the maximum recommended dose of the immediate-release product.</p>
<p>Overdose cases involving multiple CNS-depressant agents, including zolpidem tablet, have resulted in more severe symptomatology, including fatal outcomes. General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate.</p><img src="https://d4fuqqd5l3dbz.cloudfront.net/products/DrugItem_8840.JPG" alt="zolpidem er 6.25mg tablets" title="zolpidem er 6.25mg tablets" style="padding: 20px 30px 20px 30px; border: 0px;" width="429" height="347" align="left" ><p>Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed.

Similarly, chlorpromazine in combination with zolpidem tartrate produced no pharmacokinetic interaction, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness and psychomotor performance. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose administration does not predict a lack following chronic administration.</p>
<p>An additive effect on psychomotor performance between alcohol and zolpidem tartrate was demonstrated. A single-dose <i>tablet</i> study with zolpidem tartrate 10 mg and <i>zolpidem</i> 20 mg at steady-state levels in male tablets did not demonstrate any clinically significant pharmacokinetic <b>6.25mg</b> pharmacodynamic interactions.</p>

<p>Review safety precautions with regard to <i>6.25mg,</i> especially for elderly and debilitated patients. Caution patient that medication may be habit forming and to take as prescribed. Immediate-release zolpidem tartrate was administered to 3, tablets in clinical trials throughout the U. Treatment-emergent adverse events associated with clinical trial participation were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of zolpidem own choosing.</p>
<p>To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events, similar types of untoward events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized event categories and classified utilizing a modified World Health Organization WHO dictionary of preferred terms.
