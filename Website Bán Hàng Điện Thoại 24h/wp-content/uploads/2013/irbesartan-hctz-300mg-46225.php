		<p><p>Do not dispose of medications in wastewater e. Ask your pharmacist how to dispose of medications that are no longer needed or have expired. Who should NOT take this medication? Do not take irbesartan if you: Many medications can cause side effects. A side effect is an unwanted response to a medication when it is taken in normal doses. Side effects can be mild or severe, temporary or permanent. The side effects listed below are not experienced by everyone who takes this medication.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about side effects, discuss the risks and benefits of this medication with your doctor. Many of these side effects can be managed, and some may go away on their own over time. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium.</p>
<p>The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so coadministration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood. Pharmacokinetics Irbesartan Irbesartan is an orally active agent that does not require biotransformation into an active form.</p>
<p>Following oral administration of irbesartan, peak plasma concentrations of irbesartan are attained at 1. Food does not affect the bioavailability of irbesartan.</p>
<p>Irbesartan exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range. The terminal elimination half-life of irbesartan averaged 11—15 hours. Steady-state concentrations are achieved within 3 days.</p>
<p>Hydrochlorothiazide When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours, the plasma half-life has been observed to vary between 5. Metabolism and Elimination Irbesartan Irbesartan is metabolized via glucuronide conjugation and oxidation. Irbesartan and its metabolites are excreted by both biliary and renal routes. In vitro studies of irbesartan oxidation by cytochrome P isoenzymes indicated irbesartan was oxidized primarily by 2C9; metabolism by 3A4 was negligible.</p>
<p>Irbesartan was neither metabolized by, nor did it substantially induce or inhibit, isoenzymes commonly associated with drug metabolism 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2D6, 2E1. There was no induction or inhibition of 3A4. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney.</p>
<p>The average volume of distribution is 53—93 liters. Total plasma and renal clearances are in the range of — and 3. With repetitive dosing, irbesartan accumulates to no clinically relevant extent. Studies in animals indicate that radiolabeled irbesartan weakly crosses the blood-brain barrier and placenta.</p>
<p>Irbesartan is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. Hydrochlorothiazide Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk. Gender No gender related differences in pharmacokinetics were observed in healthy elderly age 65—80 years or in healthy young age 18—40 years subjects. No gender-related dosage adjustment is necessary.</p>
<p>No dosage adjustment is necessary in the elderly. Renal Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of irbesartan were not altered in patients with renal impairment or in patients on hemodialysis.</p>
<p>Irbesartan is not removed by hemodialysis. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to severe renal impairment unless a patient with renal impairment is also volume depleted.</p>
<p>Hepatic Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of irbesartan following repeated oral administration were not significantly affected in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis of the liver. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic insufficiency.</p>
<p>Drug Interactions Pharmacodynamics Irbesartan In healthy subjects, single oral irbesartan doses of up to mg produced dose-dependent inhibition of the pressor effect of angiotensin II infusions. In hypertensive patients, angiotensin II receptor inhibition following chronic administration of irbesartan causes a 1.</p>
<p>Aldosterone plasma concentrations generally decline following irbesartan administration, but serum potassium levels are not significantly affected at recommended doses. In hypertensive patients, chronic oral doses of irbesartan up to mg had no effect on glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow or filtration fraction. In multiple dose studies in hypertensive patients, there were no clinically important effects on fasting triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, or fasting glucose concentrations.</p>
<p>There was no effect on serum uric acid during chronic oral administration and no uricosuric effect. Hydrochlorothiazide After oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, diuresis begins within 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. Clinical Studies Irbesartan The antihypertensive effects of irbesartan were examined in seven 7 major placebo-controlled, 8—12 week trials in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95— mmHg.</p>
<p>Doses of 1— mg were included in these trials in order to fully explore the dose-range of irbesartan. Two of the seven placebo-controlled trials identified above and two additional placebo-controlled studies examined the antihypertensive effects of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination.</p>
<p>The seven 7 studies of irbesartan monotherapy included a total of patients randomized to irbesartan 1— mg and patients randomized to placebo. No further increase in effect was seen at dosages greater than mg. There was essentially no change in average heart rate in irbesartan-treated patients in controlled trials. These trials included patients randomized to fixed doses of irbesartan  Study I was a factorial study that compared all combinations of irbesartan  Study IV investigated the effects of the addition of irbesartan 75 mg or mg in patients not controlled SeDBP 93 to mmHg on hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg alone.</p>
<p>Once-daily dosing with mg irbesartan and  Initial Therapy Studies V and VI had no placebo group, so effects described below are not all attributable to irbesartan or hydrochlorothiazide. For patients treated with irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, the mean change from baseline in SeDBP was 3.</p>
<p>Withdrawal rates were 3. The mean SeDBP was 4. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose. What happens if I overdose? Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at  Overdose symptoms may include fast or slow heartbeat, feeling light-headed, or fainting. What should I avoid while taking hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan?</p>
<p>Drinking alcohol can further lower your blood pressure and may increase certain side effects of hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan. Avoid becoming overheated or dehydrated during exercise and in hot weather.</p>
<p>Follow your doctor's instructions about the type and amount of liquids you should drink. In some cases, drinking too much liquid can be as unsafe as not drinking enough. Do not use potassium supplements or salt substitutes while you are taking hydrochlorothiazide and irbesartan, unless your doctor has told you to.</p>
