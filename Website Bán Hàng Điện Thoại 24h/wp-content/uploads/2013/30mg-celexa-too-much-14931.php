		<p><p>I feel stable on 30mg, but still ocasionally have my bad days. Non of the other doctors in the practice have ever said it is high. I won't see him again as i felt he was rude and arsey too and luckily there are enough other doctors in the practice to see.</p>
<p>But i just wondered if anyone else had been told 30mg was high really. I have been on it for four years and I have been on 20mg for just over a year. That is considered a low dose. I was only a high dose of 60mg for a while. My doctor told me 60 was high. I saw him last week and he said 20 was next to nothing and he was happy for me to stay on that. The most monumental improvement for me is that for the first time in years, I am actually getting some sleep.</p>
<p>Bit of weight gain nothing too dramatic and zero energy some days. Overall though, my quality of sleep and life has increased tenfold and life is a lot less daunting on a daily basis. Finally, I can give some clarity to the point raised by Cyncyn.</p>
<p>Yes it's a high dose, but the recent change in advice is that GP's do not prescribe 40mg or over to those over due to heart-related complications. The current advice states that higher doses in those below 60 is perfectly safe. I've posted on this because I've been exactly where you are and can only say that the little extra dose every day has helped me.</p>
<p>I hope it does for you too, but there are many alternatives. This is not the first type I've tried, but with some help from a great GP, I'm feeling a lot more optimistic these past few months.
