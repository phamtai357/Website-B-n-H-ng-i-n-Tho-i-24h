		<p><p>Check with your health care provider before you start, stop, or change the dose of any medicine. Cialis may cause dizziness, drowsiness, fainting, or blurred vision. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Cialis with caution. Do not drive or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it. Cialis may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting; alcohol, hot weather, exercise, or fever may increase these effects.</p>
<p>To prevent them, sit up or stand slowly, especially in the morning. Sit or lie down at the first sign of any of these effects.</p>
<p>Do not drink large amounts of alcohol eg, 5 drinks or more while you take Cialis. Doing so may increase your risk of dizziness, headache, fast heartbeat, and low blood pressure.</p>
<p>Patients with heart problems who take Cialis may be at increased risk for heart-related side effects, including heart attack or stroke. Symptoms of a heart attack may include chest, shoulder, neck, or jaw pain; numbness of an arm or leg; severe dizziness, headache, nausea, stomach pain, or vomiting; fainting; or vision changes.</p>
<p>Symptoms of a stroke may include confusion; vision or speech changes; one-sided weakness; or fainting. Contact your doctor or seek medical attention right away if you experience these symptoms.</p>
<p>Cialis may rarely cause a prolonged eg, more than 4 hours or painful erection. This could happen even when you are not having sex. If this is not treated right away, it could lead to permanent sexual problems such as impotence.</p>
<p>Contact your doctor right away if this happens. Cialis will not prevent pregnancy. If your partner may become pregnant and you wish to avoid pregnancy, be sure to use an effective form of birth control. Contact your doctor if vision changes persist or are severe. Rarely, an eye problem called nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy NAION has been reported in patients who took Cialis.</p>
<p>This may lead to decreased vision or permanent loss of vision in some cases. If you notice a sudden decrease in vision or loss of vision in one or both eyes, contact your doctor right away. Sudden decreases in hearing and loss of hearing have been reported in some patients who have taken Cialis. Sometimes they also noticed ringing in the ears or dizziness. If you notice a sudden decrease or loss of hearing, contact your doctor right away. Do not use other medicines or treatments for ED while you are taking Cialis without first checking with your doctor.</p>
<p>Use Cialis with caution in the elderly; they may be more sensitive to its effects. Cialis is not recommended for use in children younger 18 years. All medicines may cause side effects, but many people have no, or minor, side effects. Check with your doctor if any of these most common side effects persist or become bothersome: Dizziness; flushing; headache; heartburn; mild back or muscle pain; stomach upset; stuffy or runny nose.</p>
<p>Seek medical attention right away if any of these severe side effects occur: Severe allergic reactions rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue ; chest pain; fainting; fast or irregular heartbeat; memory loss; numbness of an arm or leg; one-sided weakness; prolonged, painful erection; red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin; ringing in the ears; seizures; severe or persistent back or muscle pain; severe or persistent dizziness; severe or persistent vision changes; sudden decrease or loss of hearing; sudden decrease or loss of vision in one or both eyes.</p>
<p>This is not a complete list of all side effects that may occur. If you have questions about side effects, contact your health care provider. Viagra Men frequently ask us what the difference between Viagra and Cialis is. Both medications essentially work in the same way. The main difference is that Cialis works for up to 36 hours, whereas the effect of Viagra will subside within four hours of swallowing the tablet.</p>
<p>Once you have taken Cialis, you will find it easier to gain an erection for up to 36 hours without having to take any additional pills. Some men prefer Cialis on the basis that it gives them more flexibility. Can I take Cialis every day? Cialis is not meant for everyday use. The 10mg and 20mg tablets should not be taken daily. If you would like to take Cialis on a daily basis, you can discuss this option with a doctor. Depending on your general health, you may be able to take a C ialis daily 5mg to aid your erections.</p>
<p>Is Cialis safe to take? Cialis is licensed in the UK and as all other medications, it has been tested to establish that it is clinically safe to take. However, it is important that you buy from a reputable source to avoid potentially dangerous counterfeit medication. It is also vital that you consult your GP or an online doctor before you start your treatment to ensure that Cialis is suitable for you. Cialis Dosage How do I take Cialis? You need to take Cialis 30 minutes before sex in order to allow time for the active ingredient to take effect.</p>
<p>You can take Cialis with or without food and you should drink a glass of water when you swallow the tablet. Normally, you will take one 10mg or 20mg tablet when you know that you will be having sexual intercourse. If you expect to be having sex every day, please consult your doctor to discuss dosage options. Taking Cialis for the first time When you take Cialis for the first time, we recommend beginning with a 10mg dose.</p>
<p>If you have never used Cialis before, you may wish to allow an hour for it to work - just to be on the safe side. After the first time, you will know how quickly it works for you. If you find that the 10mg dosage is too strong or too weak, you can adjust the dosage the next time you use Cialis. Make sure you do not exceed the maximum recommended dosage of 20mg, as this could result in side effects.</p>
<p>Does Cialis need to be taken on an empty stomach?</p></p>
