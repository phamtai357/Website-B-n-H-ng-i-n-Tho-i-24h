		<p><p>All seemed to help. I just woke up and realized I'm in partnership with my doctor, but ultimately I'm responsible for my recovery, actions and well being. Thus I will be shrink shopping until I find one I trust and respect.</p>
<p>David at August 15, 1: I started taking Lexapro three months ago and it has been very good for me! Of course there were a few side effects trouble staying asleep, and jaw clenching, and dizziness. I rather have the side effects then be miserable! My mood has completely changed, I have lost 7 pounds, and I do not feel like binging and purging.</p>
<p>I was mortified when I first started taking Lexapro after reading so many negative comments but I guess things work differently on every individual. I just started today, 5 mg. I felt the same as I normally do all day, which is usually depressed. But I'm reading such negative feedback about Lexapro here. Is it just that people with negative side effects take the time to post? Or is Lexapro that bad for everyone, with few exceptions?</p>
<p>I've fought the idea of medication for so many years, but I'm so tired of depression that I thought I'd give it a try. And that gave me hope. But after reading these posts, I'm feeling the hope drain away again. Hasn't anyone had a purely good experience? Connie at August 28,  A year or so ago, I started having MS-like symptoms after consuming large amounts of artificially sweetened drinks. Since then, I have been extremely fearful of having poor health and have essentially become a severe hypochondriac.</p>
<p>The stress and depression has been almost crippling to me at times as it preoccupies my every thought. I just started taking Lexapro three days ago and I'm already noticing some minor side-effects. Jaw clenching and slight difficulty swallowing as well as a trembling shakiness in my hands.</p>
<p>I have also, however, noticed an increase in my energy level, though when combined with the shakiness it just seems like jitters. I take it 10 minutes before bed and it doesn't seem to affect my ability to sleep. It's only been three days, but I'm hoping after a week or so it starts working, because I haven't felt normal in over two years. Justin at September 10, 8: I started writing when I started. It's been about two months for me and the world has gotten alot better for me to deal with.</p>
<p>Not perfect, but alot better. I had a panic attack this morning for the first time since I've started the meds. Took a klonapin, have been cool all day. We'll see what the subway ride home is like. Take it one day at a time. Talk to a professional if you feel it will help, take good care of your self and take it easy when you first start meds. David at September 11, 4: Exausted isn't quite the word for it, over-relaxed is a better term. Walking around is difficult only because the urge to lay down and sleep is so great.</p>
<p>My legs feel weak and a little rubbery, but I don't notice any lack of strength in them. My hands don't seem to shake as badly as they did yesterday, so hopefully I'm beginning to acclimate to the drug. Justin at September 11,  I stayed up really late lastnight and woke this morning with a horrible sense of disassociation feeling like everything is happening in a fog.</p>
<p>The feeling seemed to slowly fade after an hour. Also have a pretty signifigant headache this morning as well.</p>
<p>I'm going to be seeing my doctor this morning to see how these side-effects compare to what I should be feeling. Justin at September 12,  I've noticed no one has commented in the past couple of weeks so I'll leave this comment for what it's worth. I've been through lots of different anti-deps for severe clinical depression and Lexapro just happened to be the one that I could tolerate with few side effects. I have just started taking Cymbalta because it's new and I'm feeling lower than usual.</p>
<p>Every side effect that is talked about here is all normal for most anti-deps. Different people experience the drugs differently. You have to try one and give it at least two weeks and if the side effects are too bad ask for a change.</p>
<p>Never quit cold turkey. As for orgasm, I have finally found out that using a "toy" that has suction worked, try different ways of acheiving orgasm and something might work for you. Being around children and animals have helped with my depression. So I hope this may help someone. I experience intense nausea in the beginning for a couple of days when I went from 10 to 20 mg. That passed quite quickly and I started feeling better quite soon.</p>
<p>I had night sweats, though and when I drank alcohol I would have to watch my temper and impulsiveness. It didn't help my OCD skin-picking though.</p>
<p>I went off Lexapro to get ready to try getting pregnant, which hasn't happened. I feel pretty low and depressed and am thinking about going back on Lexapro until I get pregnant but I'm afraid of the withdrawal once that happens. Basically, Lexapro helped me and I didn't find the side effects too bad. No trouble with orgasms, which I had with Prozac.</p>
<p>I've also taken Wellbutrin but it made me irritable and I lost too much weight so I went off it. The Prozac made me manic at first but that tapered off. Lexapro worked the best for me, though it wasn't perfect. I started on 20mg per day and after about 5 years I cut the dose to 10mg per day. I finally decided to wean myself off Paxil by cutting the dose to 5 mg a day. After all was said and done I seemed to be doing ok until about 3 months went by.</p>
<p>My anxiety came back full strength partially due to worrying about another unrelated health concern. My Doctor just started me on 10mg Lexapro today and I'm wondering what is average for the drug to start working. Intially Paxil started working for me in about a weeks time. Jack Crowe at October 23, 6: Talk to your DR. For me it was a heatwave in NYC and stopping drinking alchol. So take it day by day. I'm feeling so much better, the sexual dysfunction has passed, life is good again.</p>
<p>David at October 26,  I started with 5 mg each night for two nights, then switched to taking 10 mg at nights. I definitely noticed side effects as soon as I started taking Lexapro. The most noticeable effects were all-day-long headaches and mild nausea. Thankfully, those lessened noticeably over the next few days, and are now completely gone. I also noticed myself sweating a lot, especially in my hands and feet. The first couple days on Lexapro wiped out my energy, and I took several short afternoon naps.</p>
<p>Now almost two weeks later I feel like the physical side effects are over. I still feel depessed, but also sometimes I catch myself feeling okay. And while I still feel mostly down, there are more and more good times. I'm quite pleased with Lexapro so far, and am hopeful it will work.</p>
<p>In terms of sexual side effects, the jury is still out. I haven't been that horny lately, but that's because I'm depressed. The first time it came up, I was able to orgasm, but the second time I didn't attempt to. After Prozac at November 19,  I took Wellbutrin when I was younger and I found that that worked pretty well, but then my body was too used to it that I stopped and I started Effexor, which was the worst pill I had ever taken, but then my doctor introduced me to Lexapro.</p>
<p>Lexapro is a great medication and causes very few side effects if any. Like a lot of you, I was terrified of side effects! So much so that I would "make" myself think that I was sick when I started a medication. That's what mental illness does: Believe it or not Lexapro is a wonderful medication, newer, and causes very few noticeable side effects. If you are the type of person who has difficulty starting a medication the key is to say encouraging things to yourself, swallow the pill, and don't wait for symptoms or something to complain about.</p>
<p>If you do that it will delay your recovery. You don't want that. Take the medication and go on with your day as though you never took anything and do something to distract yourself so that you won't think negatively watch movies, exercise, shop, clean, whatever. To lessen your GI upset, which isn't typical of Lexapro, try taking it with yogurt. Serotonin is active in your Gastrointestinal Tract and eating yogurt while taking it will even out the effects again if any.</p>
<p>Also, yogurt is a dairy product, much like milk, and coats your stomach. To accompany yogurt, have crackers with baking soda in them. I know that I had difficulty myself starting new prescriptions and it took a lot of encouraging words and positive feedback from others.</p>
<p>The longer you wait to take the meds the worser your symptoms become. Keep in mind that your body needs time to adjust to the medication in order to make you feel better.</p>
<p>It won't happen in an hour or overnight. Things will get better for you all. I hope that helps. Leslie at December 14,  I had severe depression and anxiety attacks and I feel this drug has saved my life.</p>
<p>I have had the dry mouth, some nausea the first 2 weeks but tolerable , some trouble with sleep the first 2 weeks now I sleep like a stone and lack of appetite fine by me. I have noticed that I crave water and I have no desire to eat crappy food.</p>
<p>This combination works great. I strongly recommend giving it a chance. I wish I started a long time ago. I have my life back. Jenny at December 15, 9: I used to be a very sexual person and my libido has all but disappeared.</p>
<p>That and my poor sleeping, but I think I can deal with that. I sleep badly now but other than a ton of yawning I'm not that tired during the day. I just wanted to know what I can do about the sexual side effects both with and without medication like Wellbutrin that a lot of people seem to take for it. Amber at January 4, 2: The dose was 10mg per day, reduced to 5mg in the final month. In the first week I felt a little nauseous from time-to-time mild.</p>
<p>This was the only side-effect I noticed. By week 3, I my depression was passing. After 3 months, the doctor reduced my dose and informed me this would be my last month at my request.</p>
<p>I felt no effects of withdrawal. It's now 2 years later started treatment in Jan , and I've not needed a repeat treatment. This drug was a big help to me at the time. Wayne at January 14, 7: Suffered from GAD and extreme anger for years. Started on Lexapro 10 mg six weeks ago and I am literally a different person.</p>
<p>My wife, sister, mother-in-law, sister-in-law and brother-in law are ALL on it and all doing well. Not saying it's for everyone, but it is very good for some people. J at January 18, 9: I started with 5 mg and am now taking 10 mg daily -- no real side effects except for the first week when I experienced mild upset stomach.</p>
<p>I notice no side effects now and my GAD is very much under control. I am sleeping so much better and no longer have uncontrollable anxious feelings. It has been an excellent drug for me. Anon at January 19, 5: I wrote praising Lexapro. I neglected to say I started on Oct.</p>
<p>They did not want to just stop the buspar, which I had been on since , and am currently on a series of 2 week step downs. I take one lexapro each morning in addition to my buspar also. It is easier just to take med once a day rather than twice a day, although since I had been on buspar since had gotten into the habit of it.</p>
<p>I noticed, as others said, that my thoughts are more rational and clearer since beginning the Lexapro. Some of the letters sort of scared me I hope I do not develop any of the bad effects others spoke of. I agree, Lexapro is a God-send. Glenda at January 20,  He wanted me to stay on it indefinately, but my agreement with him last summer was 6 months and therapy, to overcome GAD. I've been weaning off of it slowly. Two months later, its all back — stress, ED, everything.</p>
<p>I went to my doctor yesterday and he gave me Viibryd. If cost is a concern, check it out. Thank you for your visit and comment… Bill s10 Day three, not really sure about this one, but its early. The first day it felt like an immediate pick me up, but that may have been my surroundings too. I tend to think everything is about me, and it affects me way too negatively — Friday night all seemed well in my world. Like pretty much everyone else, I got the GI issues, headache, and spacey unmotivated feeling — but I usually get that sort of side effects when I start taking anything.</p>
<p>The first night, the ED problem was gone, though I did take a Viagra as insurance. The headache, spacey feeling, and diarrhea is still here, but its getting better. Time will tell if this is the right drug… in the meantime I really need to find a way to better deal with my stress. Your last sentence speaks volumes! A lot of it has to do with not talking about what is bothering me — at least not to the right person. Spacey feeling is still there, GI problems are gone, memory seems bad though.</p>
<p>Not sure if I have the insomnia I keep hearing about, I have always had trouble sleeping. Headache is slight, could be allergies — unless the pill is causing that too. I was on Lexapro for years. For anxiety and depression. Last year I found out I had low testosterone. Your depressions could be stemming from a hormone imbalance Frogmen This is my day two on viibryd, i want to know if anyone felt an increase in anxiety? I have taken antidepressants before, but usually only for a short period of time, and only to "get through" difficult stages.</p>
<p>It helped at first, but then, over time, the side effects pounding heart and anxiety, primarily became more troublesome than my mental state.</p>
<p>Well, now I know I would have been better toughing through my difficult time with meditation and yoga. I work in a managerial position, and I've been trying to get off this stuff for about 9 months now.</p>
<p>Every time I taper down the suicidal thoughts, tremors, sweating, tightness in the head, and general irritability make me go back to the original dose. I had a couple of weeks vacation, and was able to taper from 20 mg to 10, and I have tolerated 10 mg okay, but still have tremors, jaw tightness, and major irritability.</p>
<p>Reading these posts help me to know that getting off this stuff is the right thing to do. I am going to go down to 5 mg tonight, and then in a month I am going to stop altogether.</p>
<p>I only hope I can keep my job. Once this drug has you, it is really hard to get off of it. Mandy at August 15,  I have only had a few side effects. Weight gain, vivid dreams and memory loss. But I feel good, not as good as I did before I got "sick" it all started with a panic attack that didn't go away. I am happy, no anxiety, no depression, not a panic attack in 6 months. I guess I don't know why everyone else is miserable and I'm not experiencing anything negative.</p>
<p>Part of me is thank full for this drug, I am no longer irritable, and see life more happily. I notice though that I don't have that normal anxiety during situation where i could probably use it.</p>
<p>Before going on the drug i was always pretty intense, and emotional, good and bad. NOw, i am more surface and react how i think i "should" act, rather than just feeling and reacting "normally". For example I have been able to sleep with four diferent guys in two weeks and really feel nothing good or bad about it. Now, that is not the real me, before going on SSRI's i was a virgin, till 21, i valued and respected myself.</p>
<p>It really bugged me and I was like , why don't I care about sex, even during sex, I enjoy it to some degree, but rarely orgasm. I tried going off a few times, cold turkey without doctors guidance or tapering I got super depressed, more than i ever remember, and thought about killing myself, I was super negative and irritable.</p>
<p>So i went back on in fear of losing my job. I felt better and more even kealed for sure But still afraid of the irritability to come back. Before chossign to go on meds, I was in therapy for years for depressiona dn anxiety. I started with Paxil and that made me gain weight and feel tired all the time, than prozac for three months, bt that made me impulsive and especially driving I'd take very scary unneccesary risks while driving So on to lexapro.</p>
<p>I tried 15mg of lexapro once or twice, but got angry easily and almos paranoid like thinking people were putting me down, so i went back to 10mg and it went away thank god.</p>
<p>It definitly numbs you, in an elusive way. But the sleepign around thing is alarming and out of character I think Any advice would be greatly appreciated, even sharing your stories to see what others are or have gone through.</p>
<p>Any advice about how to prevent going nutso once off Katie at August 22,  BOYD at August 23,  I had my first full fledged panic attack the day after I took it for the first time.</p>
<p>I have never been so scared in my entire life. I woke up terrified to go to class but I made myself go and then I left class to go to the bathroom bc my heart was beating so fast and I was so got I felt like I was going to passs out. Once in the bathroom I could not leave, even the thought of walking out to get my stuff paralyzed me.</p>
<p>It's now day three and my chest hurts from my heart beating so hard and I haven't left my house since that last attack bc I am terrified that it will happen again.</p>
<p>I'm going to call my doctor but does this sound familiar to anyone else? Please I need serious advice on this. I am so scared! Samantha at August 23,  BOYD at August 23, 1: After being cleared of any physical aliments, I was diagnosed with depression. I see a therapist and after 6 weeks of therapy decided I needed some help. After 6 weeks on this dose, I really didn't feel much difference in the depression and motativation. We doubled the dose and I have been taking 20 mg a day for 3 weeks.</p>
<p>I am happier, and back at the gym, no wt gain yet, I am experimenting with when to take the dose because I do experience lathargy. I am trying 10mg in the am and 10mg in the pm. I am not looking forward to coming off of this because of what I have read so far, but for now it is working. I do hate the non-organism part because my husband and I are active sexual, so this has put a damper on things. Deb at August 23, 6: BOYD at August 24, 2: Burning sensation in chest and back, tremors, heart racing.</p>
<p>I'll never take it again! I was in the hospital for 3 days getting tests ran on my heart. I stopped taking the lexapro at that time. Woke me up at 3am out of dead sleep.</p>
<p>Have a call in to him now to see whats up. I think I am having an allergic reaction. Dennis at August 25,  After I started, my experience with Lexapro is great. I've had absolutely no negative side effects, none in the beginning, and none now. It calmed me down, I think with a clear head, and I sleep better now than I have in years.</p>
<p>The insomnia, nausea, 'flipping out', sex drive decrease, all of that stuff never happened. Also i have a raw, swelling feeling in groin and armpits but lymp nodes are not swollen Has anyone had any of these same symptons?</p>
<p>Devin at August 30,  I was on 20mg when I began tapering by splitting my dose for about two months, I then saw my Psychiatrist and was told that it could take up to 9 months tapering down. I told her I wanted to be off of it immediately, but resigned myself to going down a half at a time. I began with 10 mg and took it at around lunchtime. That lasted for about a month when I went down to 5 mgs, boy what a difference in side effects. I had the dizziness and electric shocks when I was on the 10 mgs but it was usually if I forgot to take my dose, and would pretty much go away after I took it.</p>
<p>Before I decreased to the 5mgs I was doing really well and had forgotten my lunchtime dose several times ending up taking it later with no adverse side effects. Since the side effects did not seem to subside when I took the 5mg dose I decided to just go off of it. That was four days ago Every day I have seen an increase in the dizziness and electric shocks to the point of having the shocks coming with every breath or heartbeat.</p>
<p>I was getting a little desperate two nights ago but rode out the storm. Late afternoon and early evening are the worse for me now, but as far as my mood goes I have been rather even keel, with a little bit of an edge. Through all of this however my clarity and brain function seems to be fine, I am able to concentrate and finish tasks at work.</p>
<p>I began medical hypnosis last night with a PsyD who has had success in treating depression. I will post here as time goes on to let you know how the treatment goes and if I have any lasting side effects from the Lexapro. I feel betrayed by the drug company regarding the safety of Lexapro. I think that it is not the type of drug that can be taken safely for long periods and I think that in a rush to get it to market the long term side effects were not explored.</p>
<p>I believe that the general public has been the collective guinea pig for this medication and I would hope that the FDA would read this board and see that some people are having their lives altered and not in a good way by this medication.</p>
<p>When we finally turn to medication for help we do not expect to have our lives turned upside down. Juliana at September 2, 8: Looking back over this time, I probably seemed more mellow to other people, when in fact I just didn't give a darn.</p>
<p>These years seem something of a fog. I spent lots of time playing on my computer, watching TV, and loafing, where before I was an avid cyclist, trim and fit. On Lexapro, I felt dizzy, out of it, unmotivated. But I liked the sexual side effect--I could go for a long time, sometimes it was difficult to ejaculate at all. I've stopped the Lexapro for about five weeks now. I cut the dosage from 10mg to 5mg daily for five days, then stopped. I feel much better, and actually want to do some work around the house.</p>
<p>I feel that tears are close to the surface sometimes I'm not a crier normally , and I am a bit irritable, but that's really just my personality.</p>
<p>The sexual effects are troubling. I ejaculate within a minute or two of penetration if it lasts that long. BobbyT at September 4, 2: While Prozac in many ways gave me back my life, it took away my sex life: I asked my doctor for an alternative and she suggested Lexapro since it did not have the sexual side effects that Prozac had but worked similarly. I gave it a try. In those 3 months, I not only noticed that I was much hungrier than usual I am small and do not generally have a robust appetite , but the other more troubling side effect at least for me is that it caused my face to break out really badly.</p>
<p>I suffer with cystic acne anyway which prior to that had been under somewhat control. The Lexapro brought it over the top. I asked my doctor about it and she said she hadn't read about that in the literature. However, I happened to be speaking to a long distance friend of mine who mentioned she had tried Lexapro but had to go off because it caused havoc to her complexion.</p>
<p>In addition, her friend had a similar experience and wound up going off it. That was enough for me. I went off it too. The side effects alone would cause depression! Deb at September 5, 7: My only question is. Also does it cause terrible sexual side effects or grumpiness? I also feel a bit fatigued but I would rather have this kind of fatigue than drugged feeling. Chelsey at September 8, 6: I was on 10mg to begin with, but started having panic attack and went up to 20mg.</p>
<p>I liked the medication as it seemed to help with my depression and panic attacks. However, I never had panic attack until I started this medication.</p>
<p>I had to recently quit it cold turkey because I found out I was pregnant. This is the 6th day off of it and I can't tell if my nausea is from my morning sickness or withdrawl. I'm having extreme dizziness but only when standing and moving my head around.</p>
<p>I also have tingling sensations in my lips and left hand. I am tired all day long, but at night I get insomnia. I ended up taking 5mg today to see if it would tone down the symptoms as I haven't been able to eat much or keep it down. I'm not sure how dangerous it is for my baby, but I still have 2 weeks until my booked up ob-gyn can see me.</p>
<p>I don't know whether to continue taking a low-dose or just wait for the doctor's advice. I think your pharmacist would be able to adivise if Lexapro is safe for you and your baby. I personally am on day 15 without the meds and I am still having the dizziness and electrical shocks. I spoke to my psychiatrist Friday and she wanted to put me back on the Lexapro 10mg and Prozac for two weeks. I declined this treatment since she said that the present symptoms should subside.</p>
<p>I am still doing well otherwise, with the exception of having crying jags but everything is managable. I decided not to continue with the PsyD who was doing the medical hypnosis, I did not click with him but I intend on pursuing this with someone else, as well as acupuncture. Juliana at September 11,  His doctor started him on Lexapro. Husband felt the "fog" lift and depression was much, much better, BUT First, the left side of his body started tingling and then mild waves of numbness would wash across the left side of his body.</p>
<p>He would feel dizzy and would have to stop whatever activity he was doing to sit down until it passed. After another week or so, he would nearly pass out when he had one of these spells. Eventually, the whole side of his body would go into spasms, he would be unable to walk, his left hand would draw up and the left side of his mouth would droop and his speech was effected. I am a nurse and recognized these as signs of a stroke!!! He called the doctor and he took him off Lexapro.</p>
<p>He continued to have these symptoms for about 6 months after discontinuing Lexapro, however they became milder. So, he restarted the Lexapro after about 6 months. The effects started all over again so he quickly stopped taking it again. Citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline show linear and dose-proportional pharmacokinetics changes in drug concentration proportional to the change in dose. Plasma concentrations of these drugs are proportional to the daily dose administered and, therefore, predictable.</p>
<p>In contrast, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine and paroxetine have non-linear pharmacokinetics. Higher doses may produce much greater increases in plasma drug concentrations than would otherwise be expected. Thus, increasing the dose of paroxetine or fluoxetine can result in disproportionate and unpredictable increases in plasma levels, half-lives, and ADEs.</p>
<p>Titration of fluoxetine and paroxetine doses may therefore be more difficult than with citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline.</p>
<p>Advertisement Protein binding Fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline are highly protein bound. What is the best SSRI? Balancing benefits, side effects, cost It is difficult to say which antidepressant is the best because each person is different. No one antidepressant is going to be an ideal answer for every person. Clinically important differences exist between antidepressants for both efficacy and acceptability in favour of escitalopram and sertraline, according to the recent antidepressant meta-analysis reported in The Lancet  Sertraline may be the best choice when starting treatment for moderate to severe major depression because it has the most favourable balance between benefits, side effects, and acquisition cost.</p>
<p>A major drawback with escitalopram is a relatively high cost of its generic version. However, European data indicates that escitalopram is the most cost-effective antidepressant compared with other SSRIs  The fastest SSRI Escitalopram has a rapid onset of antidepressant effect and is a good choice when rapid antidepressant response is desirable. Fluoxetine has the most slow onset of antidepressant action.</p>
<p>T3 is another thyroid hormone that is much more active than T4 and I would not be surprised, considering your symptoms, if this would be elevated. But even if this is not the case than I still think that your thyroid is borderline? This expectation is on the basis of the combination 1 of your typical complaints, 2 the fact that you have a longstanding multinodular goiter that very often develops into hyperfunction and 3 the combination of a low normal TSH and high normal T4.</p>
<p>Even if hyperfunction is borderline it can produce substantial symptoms on the long run, which is possibly the case with you. My advice is to consult an endocrinologist who practices regular medicine. My doctor is concerned about the T3 results and told me to go see my regular Dr the first Dr is a Dr at my school I did some research and found that a high Estrogen level can cause an elevated T3 level I have been telling my doctors for years that I thought I was producing to much estrogen my question is can High Estrogen cause an elevated T3 level or am I in early stages of Graves and if it is the estrogen how do i get my doctor to test for that I have been trying for years to get my hormone levels tested and not just by one doctor.</p>
<p>You do not give the units or reference ranges for T3 and T4, but the T3 concentration, if high, will correct to normal when the low T3 uptake is taken into account. If you are taking an OCP it would explain these tests.</p>
<p>Hope this is helpful. In I had a partial thyroidectomy and was told that my biopsy revealed follicular neoplasm. I was told everything was okay.</p>
<p>InApril I was not feeling to well and visited my doctor. I have an existing B12 deficiency and thought that might be my problem but I also stopped sweating I usually sweat alot and was just not feeling to well. My T4 was checked and my levels were to low according to my doctor. I went from 75mcg to mcg and started feeling better. But in August I started noticing changes in my voice and a lump in my neck.</p>
<p>My voice started to sound shaky and the lump was preventing me from swallowing properly.. I went to my doctor and he ordered a ultrasound of the thyroid. There appeared to be a mass in the left side of the thyroid. The right having been removed in  I went for a FNA to biopsy the mass. The biopsy revealed changes of either a follicular variant of a papillary neoplasm or a follicular neoplasm.</p>
<p>I had surgery in February of  The report reads as follows. The specimen was sectioned in its entirety. The sections show multiple nodules of varying sizes and the nodules contain follicles of varying sizes some of which are very large. Some small nodules are composeds of very small follicules.</p>
<p>The largest nodule, witha nearby long black suture, is also mainly composed of follicles but show a fairly large component of papillae fomations. These papillae are arborizing in areas and have a fibrous and fibrocascular stalk. The lining epithelium is composed of columnar cells which are medium to large in height.</p>
<p>A few show nuclear grooving and a rare cell shows internuclear vacuolization and some cells show clearing the nuclei. The findings are those of a papillar carcinoma. This focus occupies approximately. This case represents papillary carcinoma.. I was told 6 weeks later of this finding. I was also told by the surgeon not to worry it was no problem because it was all removed.</p>
<p>On seeing my endocrinologist he informed that I would be needing treatment and this was not to be taken lightly.. I was put on a low iodine diet and taken off my levothyroxine. I was without my thyroid meds. Two in the area of the jaw and one in the lower left region of my clavicle.</p>
<p>Four months later my TSH levels and other blood work was done. My TSH levels were to high and I was put on mcg of levothyroxine as the Endocrinologist informed me that cancer could come back. Now it has been 5 weeks since my dosage was increased.</p>
<p>I also feel like my mind is racing and I am more irritable than normal. I do not know if the amount of levothyroxine is to much for someone of my size. I do not see the endocrinologist until Feb  Should I be concerned with the amount of levothyroxine I am taking? Lilliane Dubois Response In brief, yes. You need enough thyroxin to keep TSH near 0.</p>
<p>The exact amount can only be determined by trial. Get a blood test now. Because it was so high, should I be concerned about the pituitary gland having a problem?</p>
<p>Should Free T4 and T3 also be drawn? I have been on Synthroid 75 for 7 months now, and my TSH is down to 4. A very high TSH value indicates marked hypothyroidism. The value reflects a combination of the severity of the hypothyroidism, its duration and some individual factors.</p>
<p>As long as the level has been falling with T4 therapy, there is no need to be concerned about the pituitary gland. Laboratory follow-up for treating hypothyroidism In most patients with hypothyroidism, it is not necessary to check T4, T3, free T4 or free T3 levels during treatment. As these values can vary widely within the population and the pituitary gland is very sensitive to changes in thyroid hormone levels, monitoring just the TSH is usually sufficient.</p>
<p>I would recommend though that you dose be increased to maintain the TSH within a range of 0. I also have a history of ebstein-barr virus in which manifested itself with L sided weakness and burning- neurlogical symptoms that still remain. I have been on Synthroid mcg po qd and my T3, T4 in Feb 04 was normal.</p>
<p>I am 41 years of age. I had a child in October  For the last 5 months I have had to deal with hives. My family Dr suggested Benadryl. After they worsened, I went to see a Dermatologist who put me on Zyrtec 10 mg po qd.</p></p>
