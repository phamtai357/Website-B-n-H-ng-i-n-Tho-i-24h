		<p><p>That was a month ago. I have felt lately not like myself Now, I have been considering starting the Lexapro! Sounds like I would have an even worse problem! I was put on 10mg on July 22,  Up to date, I have very few side effects other than slight headaches. My anxiety has almost disappeared, anyhow my racing thoughts and sadness is still there.</p>
<p>Should I, increase the dosage to 20mg or I should wait a little longer for the full effect to taker place. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. Read More I have just rec'd samples of Lexapro from my doctor yesterday to treat panic attacks. I've been taking Xanax when I get an attack and they seem to be coming a bit more frequent than I'd like - so I was prescribed 5mg for the first week, then 10mg of Lexapro from my doctor.</p>
<p>I'm trying to be optimistic here Last night I actually slept pretty well, better than previous nights -- wasn't up and down like I normally am. I experienced a lot of night sweats last night. Read More Develope a one month plan including a taper off chart. Slowly decrease your dosage from everyday to 5mg a day to 5mg every other day to 5mg every 3rd day until you have stopped taking this medication.</p>
<p>This is a slow way to stop taking the medication and become independant. I recommend a similar approach to Adderal. This drug may be more difficult to stop since it provides such a rush of energy each day.</p>
<p>Maybe stop the lexapro first then stop the adderal and last work on the ambien. Read More Hello, So i've been on Lexapro 10mg for about 4 weeks now and since a couple of days ago i've been feeling very tired and sleepy to the point that all i want to do is sleep. Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes.</p>
<p>Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms. If concomitant treatment of Lexapro with a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.</p>
<p>The concomitant use of Lexapro with serotonin precursors such as tryptophan is not recommended. Treatment with Lexapro and any concomitant serotonergic or antidopaminergic agents, including antipsychotics, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms.</p>
<p>Patients should be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing treatment with Lexapro. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to the risk.</p>
<p>Case reports and epidemiological studies case-control and cohort design have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding.</p>
<p>Patients should be cautioned about the risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Lexapro and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion SIADH , and was reversible when Lexapro was discontinued.</p>
<p>Also, patients taking diuretics or who are otherwise volume depleted may be at greater risk see Geriatric Use. Discontinuation of Lexapro should be considered in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia and appropriate medical intervention should be instituted.</p>
<p>Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. One additional case of hypomania has been reported in association with Lexapro treatment. As with all drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, Lexapro should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania.</p>
<p>Seizures Although anticonvulsant effects of racemic citalopram have been observed in animal studies, Lexapro has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder. These patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In clinical trials of Lexapro, cases of convulsion have been reported in association with Lexapro treatment. Like other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, Lexapro should be introduced with care in patients with a history of seizure disorder.</p>
<p>Because any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, however, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Lexapro therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.</p>
<p>Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness Clinical experience with Lexapro in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited. Caution is advisable in using Lexapro in patients with diseases or conditions that produce altered metabolism or hemodynamic responses. Lexapro has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease.</p>
<p>Patients with these diagnoses were generally excluded from clinical studies during the product's premarketing testing. In subjects with hepatic impairment, clearance of racemic citalopram was decreased and plasma concentrations were increased.</p>
<p>Because escitalopram is extensively metabolized, excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. Information for Patients Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe Lexapro. Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of Lexapro and triptans, tramadol or other serotonergic agents. The effect of Lexapro on psychomotor coordination, judgment, or thinking has not been systematically examined in controlled studies.</p>
<p>Because psychoactive drugs may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Lexapro therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities.</p>
<p>Patients should be told that, although Lexapro has not been shown in experiments with normal subjects to increase the mental and motor skill impairments caused by alcohol, the concomitant use of Lexapro and alcohol in depressed patients is not advised.</p>
<p>Don't exceed your recommended dose. Precautions Before starting your treatment with Lexapro tell your doctor about all conditions you may have, especially about: Avoid using this medicine if you're pregnant or may become pregnant. Contraindications Pregnant and breastfeeding women and patients with hypersensitivity to Escitalopram can't use it. Possible side effect Side effects can be the following: If you notice the effects not listed here, contact your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>Drug interaction Lexapro can interact with following medicines: The short-term memory issues returned. The itching hasn't really returned - at least, not at the level it had been at when I'd previously been on Zoloft.</p>
<p>Every so often I'll start to feel as if the itching is coming back, but it never really rises to the level it had been at previously, and I haven't had to go back on antihistamines.</p>
<p>Perhaps my progesterone had nearly rebalanced to levels not as vulnerable as they'd been previously, after having had a break from the Zoloft? I'm currently in the process of weaning off of Zoloft again under my doctor's care , with the hope that my short-term memory issues will once again improve. Oh, and as for what I'll be taking instead of Zoloft for depression and anxiety: I'm trying a new for me type of therapy, which is a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy, and am finding that it is greatly helping me to rewire my brain and change the negative narrative.</p></p>
