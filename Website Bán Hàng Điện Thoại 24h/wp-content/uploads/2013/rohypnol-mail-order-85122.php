		<p><p>The press was portraying Courtney during this period of time as "desperate," "frantic," "afraid," etc. But the woman I was dealing with seemed to be an unbelievable opportunist, obsessed more with promoting her own career than actually finding her "suicidal" husband. These are excerpts from a conversation I had with Courtney on April 3,  She's telling me about the phony story she had planted with the Associated Press the night before.</p>
<p>She's also asking my advice on how she might "expand" her lie and take advantage of the additional publicity it will inevitably bring. Listen carefully to the comments listed below. Courtney pulled the same stunt a few days later, on Thursday night, the night she had expected Kurt's body to be discovered by Carlson and I.</p>
<p>The press reported she overdosed in her Peninsula Hotel room and that it might have been a "suicide attempt. Later, after Cobain's body was found, but while I was still in Seattle, I heard Paul Harvey report the "suicide pact" rumor on one of his radio vignettes. One of Courtney's favorite publicity tactics during this period of time was to attract sympathy from the press and, most importantly, from Kurt's adoring fans. This would help make the transition from "Nirvana fan" to "Hole fan" seem completely natural.</p>
<p>BEFa "All publicity is good publicity" Your browser does not support the audio element. BEFc "If it goes in and I deny it BEFd "The sympathy goes to me" "How's that for a spin. BEFf "It might even help sell records! This was one of the first of many conversations we had. It was too soon for me to fully understand what was really going on. Later, when I reviewed this conversation on tape, things became a little more clear. Her husband was missing. She was telling everyone he was suicidal.</p>
<p>But hey, she's got records to sell! Section ; or 2 was a substance for which an exemption for investigational use has been granted under Section of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 21 U.</p>

<p>Compliance monitoring of pain medications is crucial for eliminating or significantly curtailing abuse e. Urine drug screening is considered one of the mainstays of adherence monitoring in conjunction with prescription monitoring programs and other screening tools. When is it ordered? Drug testing is performed whenever a health practitioner, employer, legal entity, or athletic organization needs to determine whether a person has illegal or banned substances in his or her body or is compliant with prescribed medications.</p>
<p>It may be ordered prior to the start of some new jobs and insurance policies and at random to satisfy workplace, court-ordered, adherence monitoring, or athletic drug testing program requirements. Drugs of abuse testing may also be ordered by a health practitioner to monitor a known or suspected substance abuse patient or whenever a person has signs and symptoms that suggest drug use. Depending on the drug or drugs involved, these may include, for example: Dilated or small pupils.</p>
<p>The band had made it through 15 shows with another 23 to go. Cobain decided to stay in Europe. The plane trip and jet lag were too much to take in his condition. That same day, in a London hotel room, a writer for the British monthly Select was interviewing Love, who was preparing for an English tour with her band Hole.</p>
<p>The writer says that during their talk, Love was popping Rohypnol, a tranquilizer manufactured by Roche, which also makes Valium. According to pharmacists, the drug is used to treat insomnia.</p>
<p>It has also been used to treat severe anxiety and alcohol withdrawal and as an alternative to methadone during heroin withdrawal. Gold Mountain denies withdrawal as an issue in Love's and Cobain's cases. Known in some parts of Europe as Roipnol, the drug is not available in the United States. That evening, Cobain sent a bellboy out to fill a prescription for Rohypnol. He also ordered champagne from room service. It has since been revealed that some 50 pills were found in Cobain's stomach.</p>
<p>Rohypnol is sold in tinfoil packets; each pill must be unwrapped individually. A suicide note was found at the scene. Gold Mountain still denies that a suicide attempt was made.</p>
<p>He just took all of his and Courtney's money and was going to run away and disappear. He awoke from his coma 20 hours later and immediately scribbled his first request on a note pad: Cobain's doctor Osvaldo Galletta says that the singer was suffering "no permanent damage" at the time.</p>
<p>Like many of Cobain's friends, he regrets that neither Cobain nor anyone close to Cobain told him that Rome had been a suicide attempt. The days after Cobain's death were filled with grief, confusion and finger pointing for all concerned.</p>
<p>She said she was wearing Cobain's jeans and socks and carrying a lock of her husband's blond hair. According to Billig, a doctor was summoned to stay with Love at all times. The thing that weirds me out is how alone and shut out he felt. It was him that shut out a lot of his friends. Smack was just a small part of his life.</p>
<p>A co-worker of Gary Smith, the electrician who found Cobain's body, called the station with what he claimed was the "scoop of the century," adding, "you're going to owe me a lot of concert tickets for this one. Vedder left the crowd with the admonition: As a Gray Line tour bus full of curiosity seekers passed by, he explained what Cobain's music meant to him. And it puts me in a better mood.</p>
<p>I thought about killing myself a while ago, too, but then I thought about all the people that would be depressed about it. Christos Dagadakis, director of emergency psychiatry at Harborview Medical Center, says, however, that "there was no particular increase in overdoses or suicide attempts coming in to our emergency room.</p></p>
