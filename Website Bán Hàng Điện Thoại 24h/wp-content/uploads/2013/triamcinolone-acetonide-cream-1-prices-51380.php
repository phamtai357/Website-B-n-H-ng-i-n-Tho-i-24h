		<p><p>If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted.</p>
<p>If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.</p>
<p>Information for Patients Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes. Patients should be advised not to use this medication for any disorder other than for which it was prescribed. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys.</p>
<p>Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of any potent topical steroid applied to a large surface area or under an occlusive dressing should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression by using the urinary free cortisol and ACTH stimulation tests, and for impairment of thermal homeostasis.</p>
<p>If HPA axis suppression or elevation of the body temperature occurs, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, substitute a less potent steroid, or use a sequential approach when utilizing the occlusive technique.</p>
<p>Recovery of HPA axis function and thermal homeostasis are generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a patient may develop a sensitivity reaction to a particular occlusive dressing material or adhesive and a substitute material may be necessary. If irritation develops, topical corticosteroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted.</p>
<p>Triamcinolone reduces the swelling, itching , and redness that can occur in these types of conditions. This medication is a medium- to strong-potency corticosteroid. The potency depends on the strength and the form that you use. For details on the potency of your product, ask your pharmacist. How to use Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream Use this medication only on the skin.</p>
<p>Do not use it on the face, groin, or underarms unless directed to do so by your doctor. Wash and dry your hands. Before applying the medication, clean and dry the affected area. Apply a thin film of the medication to the affected area and gently rub in, usually 2 to 4 times daily or as directed by your doctor. Do not cover, bandage or wrap the area unless directed to do so by your doctor. If used in the diaper area on an infant , do not use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants. After applying the medication, wash your hands unless you are using this medication to treat the hands.</p>
<p>When applying this medication near the eyes , avoid getting it in the eyes as this may worsen or cause glaucoma. Also, avoid getting this medication in the nose or mouth. If you get the medication in your eyes , nose, or mouth , rinse with plenty of water. Use this medication only for the condition prescribed. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids.</p>
<p>Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk.</p>
<p>Systemically administered corticosteroids are secreted into breast milk in quantities not likely to have a deleterious effect on the infant.</p>
<p>Pediatric Use Pediatric patients may demonstrate greater susceptibility to topical corticosteroid-induced H PA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome than mature patients because of a larger skin surface area to body weight ratio. Hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, low plasma cortisol levels, and absence of response to ACTH stimulation.</p>
<p>Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema. Administration of topical corticosteroids to chil-dren should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen.</p></p>
