		<p><p>Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and this interaction may occur while using both drugs at their recommended doses. If co-administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is necessary in patients with normal renal and hepatic function, reduce the dose of colchicine. Monitor patients for clinical symptoms of colchicine toxicity.</p>
<p>Concomitant administration of clarithromycin and colchicine is contraindicated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment [see Contraindications 4. Concomitant use of clarithromycin with lovastatin or simvastatin is contraindicated [see Contraindications 4. Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking clarithromycin concomitantly with these statins. If treatment with clarithromycin cannot be avoided, therapy with lovastatin or simvastatin must be suspended during the course of treatment.</p>
<p>Exercise caution when prescribing clarithromycin with atorvastatin or pravastatin. In situations where the concomitant use of clarithromycin with atorvastatin or pravastatin cannot be avoided, atorvastatin dose should not exceed 20 mg daily and pravastatin dose should not exceed 40 mg daily. Use of a statin that is not dependent on CYP3A metabolism e.</p>
<p>It is recommended to prescribe the lowest registered dose if concomitant use cannot be avoided. With certain hypoglycemic drugs such as nateglinide, pioglitazone, repaglinide and rosiglitazone, inhibition of CYP3A enzyme by clarithromycin may be involved and could cause hypoglycemia when used concomitantly. Careful monitoring of glucose is recommended [see Drug Interactions 7 ]. Use quetiapine and clarithromycin concomitantly with caution. Co-administration could result in increased quetiapine exposure and quetiapine related toxicities such as somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, altered state of consciousness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and QT prolongation.</p>
<p>Refer to quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on dose reduction if co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin [see Drug Interactions 7 ].</p>
<p>There is a risk of serious hemorrhage and significant elevations in INR and prothrombin time when clarithromycin is co-administered with warfarin. Monitor INR and prothrombin times frequently while patients are receiving clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants concurrently [see Drug Interactions 7 ]. However, for patients with renal impairment, the following dosage adjustments should be considered: Similar dose adjustments should be considered in patients with reduced renal function when ritonavir is used as a pharmacokinetic enhancer with other HIV protease inhibitors including atazanavir and saquinavir see section below, Bi-directional drug interactions.</p>
<p>Effect of Clarithromycin on Other Medicinal Products CYP3A-based interactions Co-administration of clarithromycin, known to inhibit CYP3A, and a drug primarily metabolised by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of the concomitant drug. Clarithromycin should be used with caution in patients receiving treatment with other drugs known to be CYP3A enzyme substrates, especially if the CYP3A substrate has a narrow safety margin e.</p>
<p>Dosage adjustments may be considered, and when possible, serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolised by CYP3A should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving clarithromycin. The following drugs or drug classes are known or suspected to be metabolised by the same CYP3A isozyme: Drugs interacting by similar mechanisms through other isozymes within the cytochrome P system include phenytoin, theophylline and valproate.</p>
<p>Antiarrhythmics There have been post-marketed reports of torsades de pointes occurring with the concurrent use of clarithromycin and quinidine or disopyramide. Electrocardiograms should be monitored for QT prolongation during co-administration of clarithromycin with these drugs. Serum levels of quinidine and disopyramide should be monitored during clarithromycin therapy. There have been post marketing reports of hypoglycemia with the concomitant administration of clarithromycin and disopyramide.</p>
<p>Therefore blood glucose levels should be monitored during concomitant administration of clarithromycin and disopyramide.</p>
<p>Careful monitoring of glucose is recommended. Omeprazole Clarithromycin mg every 8 hours was given in combination with omeprazole 40 mg daily to healthy adult subjects. The mean hour gastric pH value was 5. Sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil Each of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors is metabolised, at least in part, by CYP3A, and CYP3A may be inhibited by concomitantly administered clarithromycin.</p>
<p>Co-administration of clarithromycin with sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil would likely result in increased phosphodiesterase inhibitor exposure. Reduction of sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil dosages should be considered when these drugs are co-administered with clarithromycin. Dose reduction may need to be considered. In this population subset, inhibition of CYP3A results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine.</p>
<p>A reduction in tolterodine dosage may be necessary in the presence of CYP3A inhibitors, such as clarithromycin in the CYP2D6 poor metaboliser population. If intravenous midazolam is co-administered with clarithromycin, the patient must be closely monitored to allow dose adjustment. Drug delivery of midazolam via oromucosal route, which could bypass pre-systemic elimination of the drug, will likely result in a similar interaction to that observed after intravenous midazolam rather than oral administration.</p>
<p>The same precautions should also apply to other benzodiazepines that are metabolised by CYP3A, including triazolam and alprazolam. For benzodiazepines which are not dependent on CYP3A for their elimination temazepam, nitrazepam, lorazepam , a clinically important interaction with clarithromycin is unlikely.</p>
<p>There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions and central nervous system CNS effects e. Monitoring the patient for increased CNS pharmacological effects is suggested.</p>
<p>Digoxin Digoxin is thought to be a substrate for the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein Pgp. Clarithromycin is known to inhibit Pgp. When clarithromycin and digoxin are administered together, inhibition of Pgp by clarithromycin may lead to increased exposure to digoxin.</p>
<p>Elevated digoxin serum concentrations in patients receiving clarithromycin and digoxin concomitantly have also been reported in post marketing surveillance. Some patients have shown clinical signs consistent with digoxin toxicity, including potentially fatal arrhythmias. Serum digoxin concentrations should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving digoxin and clarithromycin simultaneously.</p>
<p>Zidovudine Simultaneous oral administration of clarithromycin tablets and zidovudine to HIV-infected adult patients may result in decreased steady-state zidovudine concentrations.</p>
<p>Because clarithromycin appears to interfere with the absorption of simultaneously administered oral zidovudine, this interaction can be largely avoided by staggering the doses of clarithromycin and zidovudine to allow for a 4-hour interval between each medication. This interaction does not appear to occur in paediatric HIV-infected patients taking clarithromycin suspension with zidovudine or dideoxyinosine. This interaction is unlikely when clarithromycin is administered via intravenous infusion.</p>
<p>Phenytoin and Valproate There have been spontaneous or published reports of interactions of CYP3A inhibitors, including clarithromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolised by CYP3A e. Serum level determinations are recommended for these drugs when administered concomitantly with clarithromycin. Increased serum levels have been reported. Bi-directional drug interactions Atazanavir Both clarithromycin and atazanavir are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A, and there is evidence of a bi-directional drug interaction.</p>
<p>Doses of clarithromycin greater than mg per day should not be co-administered with protease inhibitors. Calcium Channel Blockers Caution is advised regarding the concomitant administration of clarithromycin and calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 e. Plasma concentrations of clarithromycin as well as calcium channel blockers may increase due to the interaction.</p>
<p>Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias and lactic acidosis have been observed in patients taking clarithromycin and verapamil concomitantly. Itraconazole Both clarithromycin and itraconazole are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A, leading to a bidirectional drug interaction. Clarithromycin may increase the plasma levels of itraconazole, while itraconazole may increase the plasma levels of clarithromycin. Patients taking itraconazole and clarithromycin concomitantly should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effect.</p>
<p>If you take more Clarithromycin than you should If you have taken too much of this medicine, contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible. Symptoms of overdosage may be gastrointestinal symptoms. How to store Clarithromycin Keep this medicine out of the sight and reach of children. Do not use this medicine after the expiry date which is stated on the carton after EXP:. The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. If you forget to take Clarithromycin If you forget to take this medicine, continue treatment following the normal dosage, recommended by your doctor.</p>
<p>Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. The suspension must be used within 14 days after preparation. Do not suddenly stop using this medicine without discussing it first with your doctor. Otherwise symptoms may return. Possible side effects Medicines should not be disposed of via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help to protect the environment.</p></p>
