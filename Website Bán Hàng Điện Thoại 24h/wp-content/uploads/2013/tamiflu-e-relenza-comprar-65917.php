		<p><p>Renal elimination is completed within 24 hours. Patients with renal impairment: In the severe renal impairment group from the single IV zanamivir dose trial subjects were sampled after a dose of 2 mg or twice to four times the expected exposure from inhalation.</p>
<p>Using the normal dosing regimen 10mg bid , the predicted exposure at Day 5 is 40 fold lower than what was tolerated in healthy subjects after repeated iv administration. Given the importance of local concentrations, the low systemic exposure, and the previous tolerance of much higher exposures no dose adjustment is advised.</p>
<p>Patients with hepatic impairment: Zanamivir is not metabolised, therefore dose adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment is not required. Any alteration of pharmacokinetics that may occur with age is unlikely to be of clinical consequence and no dose modification is recommended. Inhaled zanamivir is not recommended because of the lack of data for use in patients with severe influenza disease.</p>
<p>There is also insufficient data regarding efficacy of intravenous peramivir for hospitalized patients. The optimal duration and dosing are uncertain for severe or complicated influenza. Treatment regimens might need to be altered to fit the clinical circumstances. For example, clinical judgment should be the guide regarding the need to extend daily treatment regimens longer than 5 days for patients whose illness is prolonged.</p>
<p>Critically ill patients with respiratory failure can have prolonged influenza viral replication in the lower respiratory tract Clinical judgment and virologic testing of lower respiratory tract specimens by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR should guide decisions to consider treatment regimens longer than 5 days for patients with severe and prolonged illness. For patients with lower respiratory tract disease, lower respiratory tract specimens, such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or endotracheal aspirates, are preferred; an oropharyngeal throat swab may be collected if lower respiratory specimens are not available.</p>
<p>Testing of lower respiratory tract specimens may yield the diagnosis when testing of upper respiratory tract specimens is negative. Multiple respiratory tract specimens collected on different days should be tested if influenza virus infection is suspected but a definitive diagnosis has not been made. Longer treatment regimens might be necessary in immunosuppressed persons who may have prolonged influenza viral replication. Such patients are at risk of developing antiviral-resistant virus.</p>
<p>A higher dose of oral or enterically administered oseltamivir has been recommended by some experts e. However, oral or enterically administered oseltamivir has been reported to be adequately absorbed in critically ill adults, with standard doses producing therapeutic blood levels Ariano, , and limited data suggest that higher dosing may not provide additional clinical benefit Abdel-Ghafar, ; Ariano, ; Kumar, ; Lee, ; South East Asia Infectious Disease Clinical Research Network,  Studies indicate that the exposure to oseltamivir carboxylate the active metabolite of oseltamivir is similar between obese and non-obese subjects for both 75 mg and mg doses given twice daily Ariano, ; Jittamala, ; Pai, ; Thorne-Humphrey,  However, for patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral or enterically-administered oseltamivir because of suspected or known gastric stasis, malabsorption, or gastrointestinal bleeding, the use of intravenous peramivir or investigational intravenous zanamivir should be considered.</p>
<p>Intravenous zanamivir is an investigational parenterally administered neuraminidase inhibitor product available only under an emergency investigational new drug EIND request to the manufacturer for compassionate use in hospitalized adult and pediatric patients with severe influenza.</p>
<p>It is possible that some influenza viruses may become resistant to oseltamivir and peramivir during antiviral treatment with one of these agents and remain susceptible to zanamivir; this has been reported most often for influenza A H1N1 viruses Graitcer, ; Lackenby, ; Memoli, ; Nguyen, ; Nguyen,  It sounds good in theory, but the reality is much less convincing.</p>
<p>The most glaring issue stems from the fact that the available anti-viral drugs do not appear to be very effective at fighting the flu and instead are associated with serious side effects. Previous versions of their review on anti-viral flu drugs revealed unresolved discrepancies in the published trials, including "substantial publication bias. As a result, the Cochrane Collaboration turned to a more reputable source of data: Clinical study reports are "unpublished, extensive documents with great detail on the trials that formed the basis for market approval.</p>
<p>What they found was that the evidence does not support claims that these drugs Tamiflu and another anti-viral drug Relenza [zanamivir] lower the risk of complications from the flu such as pneumonia or that the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>Tom Jefferson, who led the study, noted, "I wouldn't give it [Tamiflu] for symptom relief… I'd give paracetamol [Tylenol]. The World Health Organization WHO even classifies Tamiflu as an "essential" medicine, which they say are "selected with due regard to public health relevance, evidence on efficacy and safety, and comparative cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>In the prevention of flu, Tamiflu must be started within two days of contact with someone who has flu. It is given as one dose once a day for at least 10 days after contact with an infected person. When Tamiflu is used during a flu epidemic, this dose can be given for up to six weeks. Full-term babies up to 1 year of age should be given the oral suspension in a dose of 3 mg per kg body weight the dose to use in premature babies has not been determined.</p>
<p>Older patients who cannot swallow capsules may also receive the appropriate dose of the oral suspension. If the powder for oral suspension is not available, the pharmacist can make up a solution using the contents of the capsules, or the contents of the capsules can be mixed into sweetened food at home. The solution made up by a pharmacist is preferable to a home preparation as a pharmacist can measure the dose more accurately. The doses may need to be lower in patients who have kidney problems.</p>
