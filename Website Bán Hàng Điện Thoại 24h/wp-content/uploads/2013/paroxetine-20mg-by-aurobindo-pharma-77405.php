		<p><p>Body as a Whole: Prolonged QT interval, in patients with impaired renal function, has been reported very rarely. Convulsions, in patients with impaired renal function, have been reported very rarely. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.</p>
<p>Unabsorbed material should be removed from the gastrointestinal tract, the patient should be monitored, and supportive therapy should be employed. Signs of acute intoxication in I. Duodenal Ulcer Acute Therapy: The recommended adult oral dosage for active duodenal ulcer is 40 mg once a day at bedtime.</p>
<p>Most patients heal within 4 weeks; there is rarely reason to use famotidine at full dosage for longer than 6 to 8 weeks. A regimen of 20 mg b. The recommended adult oral dose is 20 mg once a day at bedtime. Benign Gastric Ulcer Acute Therapy: The recommended adult oral dosage for active benign gastric ulcer is 40 mg once a day at bedtime. Is Auro Paroxetine Tablet safe while breastfeeding? Please discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor. If you experience drowsiness , dizziness, hypotension or a headache as side-effects when using Auro Paroxetine Tablet medicine then it may not be safe to drive a vehicle or operate heavy machinery.</p>
<p>One should not drive a vehicle if using the medicine makes you drowsy, dizzy or lowers your blood-pressure extensively. Pharmacists also advise patients not to drink alcohol with medicines as alcohol intensifies drowsiness side-effects.</p>
<p>Please check for these effects on your body when using Auro Paroxetine Tablet. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying.</p>
<p>PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1, live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective case-control study of women whose infants were born with PPHN and women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy.</p>
<p>There is currently no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy; this is the first study that has investigated the potential risk. There have also been postmarketing reports of premature births in pregnant women exposed to paroxetine or other SSRIs. Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal study of women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication.</p>
<p>In a subset of patients classified as bipolar, the rate of manic episodes was 2. As with all drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, paroxetine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania.</p>
<p>Seizures During premarketing testing, seizures occurred in 0. Paroxetine should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures. It should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures.</p>
<p>Abnormal dreams, paresthesia, and dizziness. In the majority of patients, these events were mild to moderate and were self-limiting and did not require medical intervention.</p>
<p>During marketing of paroxetine and other SSRIs and SNRIs, there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon the discontinuation of these drugs particularly when abrupt , including the following: Dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances e. The same precautions observed when treating patients with major depressive disorder should therefore be observed when treating patients with other psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>Patients with a history of suicide-related events, or those exhibiting a significant degree of suicidal ideation prior to commencement of treatment are known to be at greater risk of suicidal thoughts or suicide attempts, and should receive careful monitoring during treatment. A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials of antidepressant drugs in adult patients with psychiatric disorders showed an increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to placebo in patients less than 25 years old see also section 5.</p>
<p>Close supervision of patients and in particular those at high risk should accompany drug therapy especially in early treatment and following dose changes. Patients and caregivers of patients should be alerted about the need to monitor for any clinical worsening, suicidal behaviour or thoughts and unusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms present.</p>
<p>This is most likely to occur within the first few weeks of treatment. In patients who develop these symptoms, increasing the dose may be detrimental. As these syndromes may result in potentially life-threatening conditions, treatment with paroxetine should be discontinued if such events characterised by clusters of symptoms such as hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, mental status changes including confusion, irritability, extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.</p>
<p>Paroxetine should not be used in combination with serotonin-precursors such as L-tryptophan, oxitriptan due to the risk of serotonergic syndrome see section 4. Mania As with all antidepressants, paroxetine should be used with caution in patients with a history of mania. Paroxetine should be discontinued in any patient entering a manic phase. Epilepsy As with other antidepressants, paroxetine should be used with caution in patients with epilepsy. Seizures Overall the incidence of seizures is less than 0.</p>
<p>The medicinal product should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures. Glaucoma As with other SSRI's, paroxetine can cause mydriasis and should be used with caution in patients with narrow angle glaucoma or history of glaucoma.</p>
<p>Cardiac conditions The usual precautions should be observed in patients with cardiac conditions. Hyponatraemia Hyponatraemia has been reported rarely, predominantly in the elderly. Caution should also be exercised in those patients at risk of hyponatraemia e.</p>
<p>The hyponatraemia generally reverses on discontinuation of paroxetine. Like Prozac, Paxil is less likely to cause typical side effects associated with older medications. Tricyclic antidepressants like Elavil, Tofranil, Sinequan and Pamelor often produce dry mouth, dizziness, weight gain, and a sluggish or lethargic feeling. Paxil may not have these effects, and may have a slight stimulant action. Less common adverse reactions include headache, palpitations, constipation, diarrhea, blurred vision and decreased libido.</p>
<p>A wide range of other reactions have been reported but appear to be uncommon. It is not known whether simvastatin is excreted into human milk; however, a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require treatment with simvastatin tablets should not breastfeed their infants [see Use in Specific Populations 8.</p>
<p>Myopathy sometimes takes the form of rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, and rare fatalities have occurred. The risk of myopathy is increased by high levels of statin activity in plasma. The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, is dose related. The incidence of myopathy with 80 mg 0. In these trials, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded.</p>
<p>In a clinical trial in which 12, patients with a history of myocardial infarction were treated with simvastatin mean follow-up 6. The incidence of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, was highest during the first year and then notably decreased during the subsequent years of treatment.</p></p>

Elderly patients may be at an increased risk. This risk persists until significant remission occurs. Short-term treatment of active duodenal ulcer.
