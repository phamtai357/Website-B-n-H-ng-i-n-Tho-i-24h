		<p><p>No pathophysiological mechanism has been identified to explain this finding, and no consistent pattern for cause of death observed. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised and the risks and benefits of this combination or co-treatment with other potent diuretics should be considered prior to the decision to use.</p>
<p>There was no increased incidence of mortality among patients taking other diuretics as concomitant treatment with risperidone. Irrespective of treatment, dehydration was an overall risk factor for mortality and should therefore be carefully avoided in elderly patients with dementia. Cerebrovascular Adverse Events CVAE An approximately 3-fold increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events have been seen in randomised placebo controlled clinical trials in the dementia population with some atypical antipsychotics.</p>
<p>The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for other antipsychotics or other patient populations.</p>
<p>The risk of CVAEs was significantly higher in patients with mixed or vascular type of dementia when compared to Alzheimer's dementia.</p>
<p>Therefore, patients with other types of dementias than Alzheimer's should not be treated with risperidone. Physicians are advised to assess the risks and benefits of the use of RISPERDAL in elderly patients with dementia, taking into account risk predictors for stroke in the individual patient.</p>
<p>All treatment options should be considered without delay, including discontinuation of risperidone. RISPERDAL should only be used short term for persistent aggression in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's dementia to supplement non-pharmacological approaches which have had limited or no efficacy and when there is potential risk of harm to self or others.</p>
<p>Patients should be reassessed regularly, and the need for continuing treatment reassessed. Orthostatic hypotension Due to the alpha-blocking activity of risperidone, orthostatic hypotension can occur, especially during the initial dose-titration period.</p>
<p>Clinically significant hypotension has been observed postmarketing with concomitant use of risperidone and antihypertensive treatment. A dose reduction should be considered if hypotension occurs.</p>
<p>Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur.</p>
<p>The onset of extrapyramidal symptoms is a risk factor for tardive dyskinesia. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear, the discontinuation of all antipsychotics should be considered. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome NMS Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, characterised by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability, altered consciousness and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels has been reported to occur with antipsychotics.</p>
<p>Additional signs may include myoglobinuria rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. Parkinson's Disease may worsen with risperidone.</p>
<p>Both groups may be at increased risk of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome as well as having an increased sensitivity to antipsychotic medicinal products; these patients were excluded from clinical trials.</p>
<p>Manifestation of this increased sensitivity can include confusion, obtundation, postural instability with frequent falls, in addition to extrapyramidal symptoms. In some cases, a prior increase in body weight has been reported which may be a predisposing factor. Association with ketoacidosis has been reported very rarely and rarely with diabetic coma.</p>
<p>Appropriate clinical monitoring is advisable in accordance with utilised antipsychotic guidelines. Patients treated with any atypical antipsychotic, including RISPERDAL, should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycaemia such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness and patients with diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.</p>
<p>Weight should be monitored regularly. Evaluation of the prolactin plasma level is recommended in patients with evidence of possible prolactin-related side-effects e. Tissue culture studies suggest that cell growth in human breast tumours may be stimulated by prolactin. Although no clear association with the administration of antipsychotics has so far been demonstrated in clinical and epidemiological studies, caution is recommended in patients with relevant medical history.</p>
<p>QT prolongation QT prolongation has very rarely been reported postmarketing. As with other antipsychotics, caution should be exercised when risperidone is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular disease, family history of QT prolongation, bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia , as it may increase the risk of arrhythmogenic effects, and in concomitant use with medicines known to prolong the QT interval.</p>
<p>Body temperature regulation Disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic medicines. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing RISPERDAL to patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e. Antiemetic effect An antiemetic effect was observed in preclinical studies with risperidone.</p>
<p>This effect, if it occurs in humans, may mask the signs and symptoms of overdosage with certain medicines or of conditions such as intestinal obstruction, Reye's syndrome, and brain tumour. Renal and hepatic impairment Patients with renal impairment have less ability to eliminate the active antipsychotic fraction than adults with normal renal function.</p>
<p>Patients with impaired hepatic function have increases in plasma concentration of the free fraction of risperidone see section 4.</p>
<p>Venous thromboembolism Cases of venous thromboembolism VTE have been reported with antipsychotic drugs. IFIS may increase the risk of eye complications during and after the operation. Current or past use of medicines with alpha1a-adrenergic antagonist effect should be made known to the ophthalmic surgeon in advance of surgery.</p>
<p>The potential benefit of stopping alpha1 blocking therapy prior to cataract surgery has not been established and must be weighed against the risk of stopping the antipsychotic therapy. Paediatric population Before risperidone is prescribed to a child or adolescent with conduct disorder they should be fully assessed for physical and social causes of the aggressive behaviour such as pain or inappropriate environmental demands. The sedative effect of risperidone should be closely monitored in this population because of possible consequences on learning ability.</p>
<p>A change in the time of administration of risperidone could improve the impact of the sedation on attention faculties of children and adolescents. Risperidone was associated with mean increases in body weight and body mass index BMI.</p>
<p>Baseline weight measurement prior to treatment and regular weight monitoring are recommended. Changes in height in the long-term open-label extension studies were within expected age-appropriate norms.</p>
<p>The effect of long-term risperidone treatment on sexual maturation and height has not been adequately studied. Because of the potential effects of prolonged hyperprolactinemia on growth and sexual maturation in children and adolescents, regular clinical evaluation of endocrinological status should be considered, including measurements of height, weight, sexual maturation, monitoring of menstrual functioning, and other potential prolactin-related effects.</p>
<p>Results from a small post-marketing observational study showed that risperidone-exposed subjects between the ages of years were on average approximately 3. This study was not adequate to determine whether exposure to risperidone had any impact on final adult height, or whether the result was due to a direct effect of risperidone on bone growth, or the effect of the underlying disease itself on bone growth, or the result of better control of the underlying disease with resulting increase in linear growth.</p>
<p>During treatment with risperidone regular examination for extrapyramidal symptoms and other movement disorders should also be conducted. For specific posology recommendations in children and adolescents see Section 4. This list is indicative and not exhaustive. Centrally-Acting Drugs and Alcohol Risperidone should be used with caution in combination with other centrally-acting substances notably including alcohol, opiates, antihistamines and benzodiazepines due to the increased risk of sedation.</p>
<p>If this combination is deemed necessary, particularly in end-stage Parkinson's disease, the lowest effective dose of each treatment should be prescribed. Drugs with Hypotensive Effect Clinically significant hypotension has been observed postmarketing with concomitant use of risperidone and antihypertensive treatment. Paliperidone Concomitant use of oral RISPERDAL with paliperidone is not recommended as paliperidone is the active metabolite of risperidone and the combination of the two may lead to additive active antipsychotic fraction exposure.</p>
<p>Both risperidone and its active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone are substrates of P-glycoprotein P-gp. Higher doses of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor may elevate concentrations of the risperidone active antipsychotic fraction e. It is expected that other CYP 2D6 inhibitors, such as quinidine, may affect the plasma concentrations of risperidone in a similar way.</p>
<p>CYP3A4 inducers exert their effect in a time-dependent manner, and may take at least 2 weeks to reach maximal effect after introduction. Conversely, on discontinuation, CYP3A4 induction may take at least 2 weeks to decline. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosage.</p>
<p>Paediatric Population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Your doctor will tell you which is the best dose for you. Immediate medical treatment may be needed. If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Risperidone Oral Solution. Risperidone Oral Solution may cause you to gain weight. Significant weight gain may adversely affect your health.</p>
<p>Your doctor should regularly measure your body weight. As diabetes mellitus or worsening of pre-existing diabetes mellitus have been seen with patients taking Risperidone Oral Solution, your doctor should check for signs of high blood sugar. In patients with pre-existing diabetes mellitus blood glucose should be monitored regularly. Elderly people with dementia In elderly patients with dementia, there is an increased risk of stroke.</p>
<p>You should not take risperidone if you have dementia caused by stroke. During treatment with risperidone you should frequently see your doctor. Medical treatment should be sought straight away if you or your care-giver notice a sudden change in your mental state or sudden weakness or numbness of your face, arms or legs, especially on one side, or slurred speech, even for a short period of time. These may be signs of a stroke.</p>
<p>Some patients may need 1 ml oral solution 1 mg risperidone twice a day.</p></p>
