		<p><p>Do not increase your dose, take it more frequently, or take it for a longer time than prescribed. Properly stop the medication when so directed. When used for an extended time, this medication may not work as well and may require different dosing. Talk with your doctor if this medication stops working well. Tell your doctor if your condition persists for more than 1 week, if it worsens, or if it occurs with fever , rash , or persistent headache. These may be symptoms of a serious medical problem and should be checked by a doctor.</p>
<p>Drowsiness, dizziness , headache , lightheadedness , blurred vision , upset stomach , nausea , constipation , increased sweating , or dry mouth may occur.</p>
<p>If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly. This medication can dry up and thicken mucus in your lungs , making it more difficult to breathe and clear your lungs.</p>
<p>To help prevent this effect, drink plenty of fluids unless otherwise directed by your doctor. Remember that your doctor has prescribed this medication because he or she has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects.</p>
<p>Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects. Tell your doctor immediately if any of these unlikely but serious side effects occur: Seek immediate medical attention if any of these rare but very serious side effects occur: This drug may infrequently cause a very serious rarely fatal nervous system disorder neuroleptic malignant syndrome. If you notice any of the following unlikely but very serious side effects, stop taking this medication and seek immediate medical attention: A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare.</p>
<p>However, seek immediate medical attention if you notice any of the following symptoms of a serious allergic reaction: This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If you notice other side effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist. In the US -Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. In Canada - Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.</p>
<p>You may report side effects to Health Canada at  See also Warning section. This medication should not be used in a person who is unconscious or has severe breathing problems e. Before taking this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to any of its ingredients; or to narcotic pain relievers e. Before using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: This drug may make you dizzy or drowsy. Significant respiratory depression Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment Known or suspected paralytic ileus Hypersensitivity e.</p>
<p>As an opioid, morphine sulfate extended-release tablets expose users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. As modified-release products such as morphine sulfate extended-release tablets deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of morphine present.</p>
<p>Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of modified-release opioids, even when used as recommended. While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dose increase. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients. In patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression, morphine sulfate extended-release tablets may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea, particularly when initiating therapy and titrating with morphine sulfate extended-release tablets, even at usual therapeutic doses.</p>
<p>Hypotension, and profound sedation, coma or respiratory depression may result if morphine sulfate extended-release tablets are used concomitantly with other CNS depressants e. Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients.</p>
<p>There is an increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised. Patients with brain tumors or increased intracranial pressure are susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention. Morphine sulfate extended-release tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. These individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people.</p>
<p>This rapid conversion results in higher-than-expected serum morphine levels. Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may experience overdose symptoms such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing.</p>
<p>The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 0. Data is not available for other ethnic groups. Such tasks should be avoided while taking this product. Alcohol and other CNS depressants may produce an additive CNS depression, when taken with this combination product, and should be avoided.</p>
<p>Codeine may be habit-forming. Patients should take the drug only for as long as it is prescribed, in the amounts prescribed, and no more frequently than prescribed. Caution patients that some people have a variation in a liver enzyme and change codeine into morphine more rapidly and completely than other people. These people are ultra-rapid metabolizers and are more likely to have higher-than-normal levels of morphine in their blood after taking codeine which can result in overdose symptoms such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing.</p>
<p>In most cases, it is unknown if someone is an ultra-rapid codeine metabolizer. Nursing mothers taking codeine can also have higher morphine levels in their breast milk if they are ultra-rapid metabolizers.</p>
<p>These higher levels of morphine in breast milk may lead to life-threatening or fatal side effects in nursing babies. Instruct nursing mothers to watch for signs of morphine toxicity in their infants including increased sleepiness more than usual , difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties, or limpness. Instruct nursing mothers to talk to the baby's doctor immediately if they notice these signs and, if they cannot reach the doctor right away, to take the baby to an emergency room or call or local emergency services.</p>
<p>This drug may enhance the effects of: Codeine may increase serum amylase levels. Acetaminophen may produce false-positive test results for urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether acetaminophen and codeine have a potential for carcinogenesis or mutagenesis.</p>
<p>No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether acetaminophen has a potential for impairment of fertility. Acetaminophen and codeine have been found to have no mutagenic potential using the Ames Salmonella-Microsomal Activation test, the Basc test on Drosophila germ cells, and Micronucleus test on mouse bone marrow.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Acetaminophen and codeine phosphate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Dependence has been reported in newborns whose mothers took opiates regularly during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Withdrawal signs include irritability, excessive crying, tremors, hyperreflexia, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. These signs usually appear during the first few days of life. Narcotic analgesics cross the placental barrier. The closer to delivery and the larger the dose used, the greater the possibility of respiratory depression in the newborn.</p></p>
