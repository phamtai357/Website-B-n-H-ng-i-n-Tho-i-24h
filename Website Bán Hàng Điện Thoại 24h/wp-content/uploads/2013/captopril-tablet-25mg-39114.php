		<p><p>The dosage is based on your medical condition and response to therapy. The manufacturer recommends that daily doses should not be more than milligrams of captopril and 50 milligrams of hydrochlorothiazide. To help you remember, take it at the same time each day. Most people with high blood pressure do not feel sick.</p>
<p>Inform your doctor if your condition worsens e. Dizziness, lightheadedness, drowsiness, headache, tiredness, blurred vision, loss of taste, or dry cough may occur as your body adjusts to the medication. You may also experience decreased sexual ability. If any of these effects persist or worsen, notify your doctor or pharmacist promptly. Tell your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of dehydration or mineral loss, including: Tell your doctor right away if any of these unlikely but serious side effects occur: Seek immediate medical attention if you notice any of the following rare but very serious side effects: Seek immediate medical attention if this rare but very serious side effect occurs: Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction may include: This is not a complete list of possible side effects.</p>
<p>If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. In Canada - Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to Health Canada at  Click here to view a more detailed list of Capozide side effects.</p>
<p>If it is near the time of the next dose, skip the missed dose and resume your usual dosing schedule. Do not double the dose to catch up. Routine monitoring of potassium and creatinine are part of normal medical practice for these patients. This may occur anytime during treatment. However, in rare cases, severe angioedema may develop after long-term treatment with an ACE inhibitor. In such cases, Captopril should be discontinued promptly and appropriate monitoring should be instituted to ensure complete resolution of symptoms prior to dismissing the patient.</p>
<p>In those instances where swelling has been confined to the face and lips the condition generally resolved without treatment, although antihistamines have been useful in relieving symptoms.</p>
<p>Angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx may be fatal. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, which may include subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1: The patient should be hospitalised and observed for at least 12 to 24 hours and should not be discharged until complete resolution of symptoms has occurred.</p>
<p>Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-blacks. Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor see section 4. Intestinal angioedema has also been reported rarely in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain with or without nausea or vomiting ; in some cases there was no prior facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal.</p>
<p>The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan, or ultrasound or at surgery and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain see section 4. Characteristically, the cough is non-productive, persistent and resolves after discontinuation of therapy.</p>
<p>The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up.</p>
<p>Patients at risk for the development of hyperkalaemia include those with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, or those using concomitant potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes; or those patients taking other drugs associated with increases in serum potassium e.</p>
<p>If concomitant use of the above mentioned agents is deemed appropriate, regular monitoring of serum potassium is recommended. Capoten is not recommended in association with lithium due to the potentiation of lithium toxicity see section 4. ACE inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with left ventricular valvular and outflow tract obstruction and avoided in cases of cardiogenic shock and haemodynamically significant obstruction.</p>
<p>In patients with normal renal function and no other complicating factors, neutropenia occurs rarely. Captopril should be used with extreme caution in patients with collagen vascular disease, immunosuppressant therapy, treatment with allopurinol or procainamide, or a combination of these complicating factors, especially if there is pre-existing impaired renal function.</p>
<p>Some of these patients developed serious infections which in a few instances did not respond to intensive antibiotic therapy. If captopril is used in such patients, it is advised that white blood cell count and differential counts should be performed prior to therapy, every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of captopril therapy, and periodically thereafter. During treatment all patients should be instructed to report any sign of infection e.</p>
<p>Captopril and other concomitant medication see section 4. In most patients neutrophil counts rapidly return to normal upon discontinuing captopril. Total urinary proteins greater than 1 g per day were seen in about 0. Nephrotic syndrome occurred in about one-fifth of proteinuric patients. In most cases, proteinuria subsided or cleared within six months whether or not captopril was continued. Parameters of renal function, such as BUN and creatinine, were seldom altered in the patients with proteinuria.</p>
<p>Patients with prior renal disease should have urinary protein estimations dip-stick on first morning urine prior to treatment, and periodically thereafter. In heart failure, where the blood pressure was either normal or low, transient decreases in mean blood pressure greater than 20 percent were recorded in about half of the patients. This transient hypotension is more likely to occur after any of the first several doses and is usually well tolerated, producing either no symptoms or brief mild lightheadedness , although in rare instances it has been associated with arrhythmia or conduction defects.</p>
<p>Hypotension was the reason for discontinuation of drug in 3. A starting dose of 6. In patients with heart failure, reducing the dose of diuretic, if feasible, may minimize the fall in blood pressure. Hypotension is not per se a reason to discontinue captopril.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the decrease is greatest early in the course of treatment; this effect stabilizes within a week or two, and generally returns to pretreatment levels, without a decrease in therapeutic efficacy, within two months. Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations.</p>
<p>Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue Capoten as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy.</p>
<p>Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mothers and fetus.</p>
<p>In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the reninangiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue Capoten, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother.</p>
<p>Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.</p>
<p>Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to Capoten for hypotension, oliguria , and hyperkalemia. When captopril was given to rabbits at doses about 0. No teratogenic effects of captopril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and hamsters. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death.</p>
<p>The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up. For some of these patients, it may not be possible to normalize blood pressure and maintain adequate renal perfusion.</p>
<p>Heart Failure - About 20 percent of patients develop stable elevations of BUN and serum creatinine greater than 20 percent above normal or baseline upon long-term treatment with captopril.</p>
<p>Less than 5 percent of patients, generally those with severe preexisting renal disease, required discontinuation of treatment due to progressively increasing creatinine; subsequent improvement probably depends upon the severity of the underlying renal disease.</p></p>
