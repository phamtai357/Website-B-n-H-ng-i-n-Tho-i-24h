		<p><p>It is not known whether use of amoxicillin in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood of the necessity for an obstetrical intervention. Amoxicillin use by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants. Caution should be exercised when amoxicillin is administered to a nursing woman. These analyses have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but a greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.</p>
<p>See Dosage and Administration 2. Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in a small number of patients after overdosage with amoxicillin1.</p>
<p>Crystalluria, in some cases leading to renal failure, has also been reported after amoxicillin overdosage in adult and pediatric patients. In case of overdosage, adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin crystalluria. Renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration. High blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of amoxicillin.</p>
<p>Amoxicillin may be removed from circulation by hemodialysis. Chemically, it is 2S,5R,6R [ R - - amino p-hydroxyphenyl acetamido]-3,3-dimethyloxothiaazabicyclo[3. It may be represented structurally as: In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Infections of the ear, nose, and throat — due to Streptococcus spp.</p>
<p>Infections of the genitourinary tract — due to E. Infections of the skin and skin structure — due to Streptococcus spp. Infections of the lower respiratory tract — due to Streptococcus spp. Gonorrhea, acute uncomplicated ano-genital and urethral infections — due to N. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea CDAD has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.</p>
<p>Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. Hypertoxin producing strains of C.</p>
<p>CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. If superinfections occur, amoxicillin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop an erythematous skin rash.</p>
<p>Thus, ampicillin-class antibiotics should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. Prescribing amoxicillin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Amoxicillin may be taken every 8 hours or every 12 hours, depending on the strength of the product prescribed.</p>
<p>Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including amoxicillin, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections e. When amoxicillin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed.</p>
