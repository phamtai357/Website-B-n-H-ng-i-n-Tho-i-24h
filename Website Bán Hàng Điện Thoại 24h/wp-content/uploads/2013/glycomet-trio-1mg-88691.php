<p>The most common side effects of this drug are diarrhea,bloating,stomach pain,gas,indigestion,constipation,unpleasant metallic taste in mouth,heartburn,flushing of the skin,nail changes,muscle pain. The use of this drug should be avoided if there is hypersensitivity to it. Additionally, you should avoid it if you have any of the following conditions - Cardiovascular collapse Diabetic ketoacidosis Hypersensitivity Renal disease Septicemia Drug Interaction: Make sure to consult with your doctor for starting, stopping or changing the dose or an alternative composition if absolutely required.</p>
<p>Drug Class and Mechanism Metformin reduces elevated blood glucose levels, predominantly by improving hepatic and peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin without affecting the secretion of this hormone.</p>
<p>Metformin HCl increases glucose utilization and reduces glucose production. Metformin reduces glucose production by the liver hepatic gluconeogenesis. Glucose production in liver increases by three times in type 2 diabetes patients, which is reduced to one third by Metformin. Metformin also activates AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK , which leads to an inhibitory effect on the production of glucose by liver cells.</p>
<p>AMPK activity also increases in skeletal muscle on administration of Metformin, it is known to effect GLUT4 deployment which results in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Metformin increases insulin sensitivity, thus enhancing peripheral glucose uptake as well as utilization.</p>
<p>It also increases fatty acid oxidation and decreases intestinal absorption of glucose. Increased peripheral utilization of glucose is due to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors. The effects of Metformin HCl are generally moderate and do not cause hypoglycemia or increased weight gain. A risk of lactic acidosis is negligible provided the contraindications, perticularly renal failure are respected.
