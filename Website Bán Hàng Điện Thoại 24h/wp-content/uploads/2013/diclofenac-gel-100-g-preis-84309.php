		<p><p>In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3, patients treated for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1, patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic.</p>
<p>Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure.</p>
<p>Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. Physicians should measure transaminases periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms.</p>
<p>The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac.</p>
<p>However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. To minimize the possibility that hepatic injury will become severe between transaminase measurements, physicians should inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity e. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible.</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised in prescribing diclofenac sodium with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic e. Hypertension NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical gel, can lead to the onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular events.</p>
<p>Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical gel should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Blood pressure should be monitored closely during the initiation of therapy with diclofenac sodium topical gel and throughout the course of therapy.</p>
<p>Diclofenac sodium topical gel should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of an NSAID may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation.</p>
<p>Patients at greatest risk of this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE-inhibitors, and the elderly. No information is available from controlled clinical studies regarding the use of diclofenac sodium topical gel in patients with advanced renal disease. Therefore, treatment with diclofenac sodium topical gel is not recommended in patients with advanced renal disease. If diclofenac sodium topical gel therapy is initiated, close monitoring of the patient's renal function is advisable.</p>
<p>Anaphylactoid Reactions As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without prior exposure to diclofenac sodium topical gel. Diclofenac sodium topical gel should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs [see Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions].</p>
<p>Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs. These serious events may occur without warning.</p>
<p>Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations, and the use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other signs of hypersensitivity.</p>
<p>Diclofenac sodium topical gel should not be applied to open skin wounds, infections, inflammations, or exfoliative dermatitis, as it may affect absorption and tolerability of the drug. Diclofenac sodium topical gel should not be allowed to come into contact with the eyes or with mucous membranes.</p>
<p>The effect of diclofenac sodium topical gel under occlusive dressings has not been evaluated, and should be avoided. Pregnancy As with other NSAIDs, diclofenac sodium topical gel should be avoided in late pregnancy, because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Corticosteroid treatment Diclofenac sodium topical gel cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to exacerbation of corticosteroid-responsive illness.</p>
<p>Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. Inflammation The pharmacological activity of diclofenac in reducing inflammation, and possibly fever, may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting infectious complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</p>
<p>This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoeisis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium topical gel, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia or blood loss.</p>
<p>NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients treated with diclofenac sodium topical gel who may be adversely affected by alteration in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants should be carefully monitored.</p>
<p>Preexisting Asthma Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal. Since cross reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac sodium topical gel should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.</p>
<p>Sun Exposure Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight on treated areas because studies in animals indicated topical diclofenac treatment resulted in an earlier onset of ultraviolet light induced skin tumors. The potential effects of diclofenac sodium topical gel on skin response to ultraviolet damage in humans are not known. Eye Exposure Contact of Diclofenac sodium topical gel with eyes and mucosa, although not studied, should be avoided. Patients should be advised that if eye contact occurs, they should immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and consult a physician if irritation persists for more than an hour.</p>
<p>Laboratory Tests Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding.</p>
<p>The triad typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular CV thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction MI and stroke, which can be fatal.</p>
<p>However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment.</p>
<p>The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible.</p>
<p>Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use.</p>
<p>Although the absolute rate of death declined somewhat after the first year post-MI, the increased relative risk of death in NSAID users persisted over at least the next four years of follow-up. Use of diclofenac may blunt the CV effects of several therapeutic agents used to treat these medical conditions [e. It should not be allowed to come in contact with the eyes.</p>
<p>Patients should understand the importance of monitoring and follow-up evaluation, the signs and symptoms of dermal adverse reactions, and the possibility of irritant or allergic contact dermatitis. Exposure to sunlight and the use of sunlamps should be avoided. Cardiovascular Thrombotic Events Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of cardiovascular thrombotic events, including chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, or slurring of speech, and to report any of these symptoms to their health care provider immediately.</p>
<p>Heart Failure and Edema Advise patients to be alert for the symptoms of congestive heart failure including shortness of breath, unexplained weight gain, or edema and to contact their healthcare provider if such symptoms occur.</p>
<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There did not appear to be any increase in drug-related neoplasms following daily topical applications of diclofenac sodium gel for 2 years at concentrations up to 0.</p></p>
