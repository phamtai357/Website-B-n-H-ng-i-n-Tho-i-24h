		<p><p>But, in when the manufacturer of OxyContin began to market and distribute the drug, concerns and reports of illicit use and abuse began to increase.</p>
<p>Now, abuse of the drug has expanded throughout the United States. While legal doses vary by patient, a typical dose prescribed by a physician ranges from two to four tablets daily. Currently there are four dosages available - 10, 20, 40, and 80mg tablets. The mg tablet available in was suspended in May due to its severe abuse potential. Many of these methods are primarily used with OxyContin in order to defeat the time-release mechanism of the drug, causing the active ingredient to take effect almost immediately after ingestion.</p>
<p>When using OxyContin this way, the risk of an overdose increases dramatically since the drug is not intended to be used in this manner. In these patients alternative non-opioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose. Head Injury And Increased Intracranial Pressure The respiratory depressant effects of narcotics and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury , other intracranial lesions or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, narcotics produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. Opioid analgesics given on a fixed-dosage schedule have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, especially when combined with other drugs, and should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension.</p>
<p>Oxycodone may aggravate convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders, and all opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings. Tolerance And Physical Dependence Physical dependence and tolerance are not unusual during chronic opioid therapy. Significant tolerance should not occur in most patients treated with the lowest doses of oxycodone.</p>
<p>Tolerance to the analgesic effects of opioids is usually paralleled by tolerance to side effects except for constipation. Physical dependence results in withdrawal symptoms in patients who abruptly discontinue the drug or may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity.</p>
<p>The 80 mg tablets are green, marked OC on one side and 80 on the other. The mg tablets are purple, marked OC on one side and on the other. For the treatment of severe pain requiring the use of a strong opioid. OxyContin tablets should be taken at hourly intervals. The dosage is dependent on the severity of the pain, and the patient's previous history of analgesic requirements. OxyContin is not intended for use as a prn analgesic. Increasing severity of pain will require an increased dosage of OxyContin tablets, using the 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg or 80 mg tablet strengths, either alone or in combination, to achieve pain relief.</p>
<p>The correct dosage for any individual patient is that which controls the pain and is well tolerated for a full 12 hours. Patients should be titrated to pain relief unless unmanageable adverse drug reactions prevent this. The need for escape medication more than twice a day indicates that the dosage of OxyContin tablets should be increased.</p>
<p>Some patients may benefit from a starting dose of 5 mg to minimise the incidence of side effects. The dose should then be carefully titrated, as frequently as once a day if necessary, to achieve pain relief. For the majority of patients, the maximum dose is mg hourly. However, a few patients may require higher doses. Doses in excess of mg daily have been recorded. Conversion from oral morphine: Patients receiving oral morphine before OxyContin therapy should have their daily dose based on the following ratio: It must be emphasised that this is a guide to the dose of OxyContin tablets required.</p>
<p>Inter-patient variability requires that each patient is carefully titrated to the appropriate dose. A dose adjustment is not usually necessary in elderly patients. Controlled pharmacokinetic studies in elderly patients aged over 65 years have shown that, compared with younger adults, the clearance of oxycodone is only slightly reduced. No untoward adverse drug reactions were seen based on age, therefore adult doses and dosage intervals are appropriate.</p>
<p>Paediatric population OxyContin should not be used in patients under 18 years of age. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment: The plasma concentration in this population may be increased. The dose initiation should follow a conservative approach in these patients.</p>
<p>Use in non-malignant pain: Opioids are not first-line therapy for chronic non-malignant pain, nor are they recommended as the only treatment. Types of chronic pain which have been shown to be alleviated by strong opioids include chronic osteoarthritic pain and intervertebral disc disease.</p>
<p>The need for continued treatment in non-malignant pain should be assessed at regular intervals. Method of administration OxyContin tablets are for oral use. OxyContin tablets must be swallowed whole and not broken, chewed or crushed.</p>
<p>Duration of treatment Oxycodone should not be used for longer than necessary. Discontinuation of treatment When a patient no longer requires therapy with oxycodone, it may be advisable to taper the dose gradually to prevent symptoms of withdrawal. Oxycodone must not be used in any situation where opioids are contraindicated:</p></p>
