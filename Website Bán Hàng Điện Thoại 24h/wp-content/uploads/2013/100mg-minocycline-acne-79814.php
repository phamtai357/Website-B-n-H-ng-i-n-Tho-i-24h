		<p><p>Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Use In Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus often related to retardation of skeletal development. Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately.</p>
<p>While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia , hyperphosphatemia , and acidosis.</p>
<p>Under such conditions, monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended, and the total daily dosage should not exceed mg in 24 hours.</p>
<p>If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity. Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported with minocycline. Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness, or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy.</p>
<p>Minocycline can be taken with food. It causes less gastrointestinal upset than other tetracyclines. Minocycline is quite expensive. Benign intracranial hypertension has been documented in association with minocycline 6. Benign intracranial hypertension BIH is a rare but potentially serious condition.</p>
<p>Benign intracranial hypertension, also known as pseudotumour cerebri, involves a persistent rise in cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised by headache, nausea, vomiting and papilloedema with occasional sixth-nerve palsy.</p>
<p>Minocycline can cause serum sickness like reaction SSLR. The next day I called my doctor and he told me to stop taking it. I am still after 24hrs off the meds not able to stand vertical without becoming very dizzy. Couple that with the constant nausea and a migraine from hell, chest pains and a general feeling of being sore and tired I wish I had never started this drug.</p>
<p>If you are sensitive to medications I would not take this pill. Now I can't take any kind of acne meds and have severe acne. After I started this med, I got headaches, nausea, lightheaded and some temp vision bluriness.</p>
<p>Took it for 2 weeks due of the side effects, which I thought would clear up after I got used to it.. This medication added the intense effects to the already migraines I suffer from seasonal allergies. As with other tetracyclines, bulging fontanelles in infants and benign intracranial hypertension in juveniles and adults have been reported.</p>
<p>Presenting features were headache and visual disturbances including blurring of vision, scotoma and diplopia. Permanent vision loss has been reported. Treatment should cease if evidence of raised intracranial pressure develops. As with other tetracyclines, minocycline may cause hyperpigmentation at various body sites see also sections 4.</p>
<p>Hyperpigmentation may present regardless of dose or duration of therapy but develops more commonly during long term treatment. Patients should be advised to report any unusual pigmentation without delay and minocycline should be discontinued. This is generally reversible on cessation of therapy. Talk to your pharmacist for more details. Before using this medication , tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: This drug may make you dizzy.</p>
<p>Do not drive, use machinery, or do any activity that requires alertness until you are sure you can perform such activities safely. This medication may make you more sensitive to the sun. Limit your time in the sun.</p>
<p>Avoid tanning booths and sunlamps. Use sunscreen and wear protective clothing when outdoors. Minocycline may cause live bacterial vaccines such as typhoid vaccine to not work as well. Before having surgery, tell your doctor or dentist about all the products you use including prescription drugs , nonprescription drugs, and herbal products. Children younger than 8 years may be more sensitive to the side effects of minocycline, especially tooth discoloration.</p>
<p>Tooth discoloration has also occurred in older children and in young adults. Discuss the risks and benefits of this medication with the doctor. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. You should not become pregnant while using minocycline.</p>
<p>Minocycline may harm an unborn baby. If you become pregnant, talk to your doctor right away about the risks and benefits of this medication. This medication passes into breast milk in small amounts but is unlikely to harm a nursing infant.</p>
<p>Consult your doctor before breast -feeding. Interactions See also How to Use section.</p></p>
