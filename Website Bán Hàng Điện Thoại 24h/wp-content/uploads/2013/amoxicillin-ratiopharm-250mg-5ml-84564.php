		<p><p>Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction has been seen following amoxicillin treatment of Lyme disease see section 4. It results directly from the bactericidal activity of amoxicillin on the causative bacteria of Lyme disease, the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi.</p>
<p>Patients should be reassured that this is a common and usually self-limiting consequence of antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease. Overgrowth of non-susceptible microorganisms Prolonged use may also occasionally result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms.</p>
<p>Antibiotic-associated colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild to life threatening see section 4.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhoea during, or subsequent to, the administration of any antibiotics. Should antibiotic-associated colitis occur, amoxicillin should immediately be discontinued, a physician consulted and an appropriate therapy initiated.</p>
<p>Anti-peristaltic medicinal products are contra-indicated in this situation. Prolonged therapy Periodic assessment of organ system functions; including renal, hepatic and haematopoietic function is advisable during prolonged therapy.</p>
<p>Elevated liver enzymes and changes in blood counts have been reported see section 4. Anticoagulants Prolongation of prothrombin time has been reported rarely in patients receiving amoxicillin. Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concomitantly. Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation see section 4.</p>
<p>Crystalluria In patients with reduced urine output, crystalluria has been observed very rarely, predominantly with parenteral therapy. During the administration of high doses of amoxicillin, it is advisable to maintain adequate fluid intake and urinary output in order to reduce the possibility of amoxicillin crystalluria.</p>
<p>In patients with bladder catheters, a regular check of patency should be maintained see section 4. Interference with diagnostic tests Elevated serum and urinary levels of amoxicillin are likely to affect certain laboratory tests. Due to the high urinary concentrations of amoxicillin, false positive readings are common with chemical methods. It is recommended that when testing for the presence of glucose in urine during amoxicillin treatment, enzymatic glucose oxidase methods should be used.</p>
<p>The presence of amoxicillin may distort assay results for oestriol in pregnant women. If you take this medicine for a long time, your doctor may perform additional tests to check your kidneys, liver and blood are working normally.</p>
<p>Other medicines and Amoxicillin Oral Suspension Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, especially: Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Amoxicillin can have side effects and the symptoms such as allergic reactions, dizziness and convulsions may make you unfit to drive.</p>
<p>Do not drive or operate machinery unless you are feeling well. This should be taken into account in patients with diabetes mellitus. Also, if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact 88mm your doctor before taking this medicine.</p>
<p>Also contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate E which may cause allergic reactions possibly delayed. Do not further dilute the prepared product. The dose will be different for different medical conditions and patients. Your doctor has decided the dose which is best for you. Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. Your doctor will advise you how much Amoxicillin you should give to your baby or child.</p>
<p>The maximum recommended dose is mg for each kilogram of body weight a day. Adults, elderly patients and children weighing 40 kg or more This suspension is not usually prescribed for adults and children weighing more than 40kg. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice. Kidney problems If you have kidney problems the dose might be lower than the usual dose. It is important that you take your medicine at the right times of day.</p>
<p>Space the doses out as evenly as possible throughout the day. Take the bottle with you so that the medicine can be identified. If you forget to take Amoxicillin Oral Suspension If you forget to take a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as you remember.</p>
<p>Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C.</p>
<p>Development Of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing AMOXIL in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria Use In Patients With Mononucleosis A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus amoxicillin should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis.</p>
<p>Phenylketonurics Amoxil chewable tablets contain aspartame which contains phenylalanine. Each mg chewable tablet contains 1. The oral suspensions of Amoxil do not contain phenylalanine and can be used by phenylketonurics. Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.</p>
<p>Studies to detect mutagenic potential of amoxicillin alone have not been conducted; however, the following information is available from tests on a 4: AUGMENTIN was weakly positive in the mouse lymphoma assay, but the trend toward increased mutation frequencies in this assay occurred at doses that were also associated with decreased cell survival.</p></p>
