		<p><p>Based on limited data, the half-life of the absorbed orlistat is in the range of 1 to 2 hours. Specific Populations No pharmacokinetic study was conducted for specific populations such as geriatric, different races, and patients with renal and hepatic impairment.</p>
<p>The effect of commencing orlistat treatment in patients on stable amiodarone therapy has not been studied. Glyburide In 12 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 80 mg three times a day for 5 days, orlistat did not alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics blood glucose -lowering of glyburide.</p>
<p>Oral Contraceptives In 20 normal-weight female subjects, the treatment of XENICAL mg three times a day for 23 days resulted in no changes in the ovulation -suppressing action of oral contraceptives. There is no doubt that following a healthy, balanced diet and doing a reasonable amount of exercise is the only way to lose weight and keep it off over the long term. However, if your health is at risk and you are struggling to lose weight , using a weight loss treatment such as Xenical can help make your efforts more successful.</p>
<p>How does Xenical work? Xenical orlistat tablets contain the active ingredient orlistat i. This means it won't influence your mood and makes the effects of this medication more predictable. Once in your body, Xenical works to prevent enzymes from breaking down fat so that it can be absorbed by your digestive system and stored.</p>
<p>This means that a third of the fat per meal you consume gets blocked and just passes through your system, working essentially as a fat blocker. We also recommend that you use a vitamin supplement when you take this medication, as some vitamins are absorbed with the fat you consume. Xenical orlistat is currently the only available prescription weight loss medication to help people to lose weight. The benefits of taking Xenical obviously transfer into your health, and you'll notice this sooner than you think too.</p>
<p>Not only will be feel healthy, have far more energy and loads more self-confidence, losing weight can reduce your chances of developing problems such as; high blood pressure , high cholesterol , heart disease and diabetes. The difference between fat blockers and appetite suppressants This can be confusing, so let us explain; fat blockers work directly in your stomach by allowing fat to pass through your body instead of being stored as mentioned above whilst appetite suppressants triggers the brain into thinking you're full.</p>
<p>There are two main pluses of choosing a fat blocker rather than an appetite suppressant: There were no clinically significant changes observed in gallbladder motility, bile composition or lithogenicity, or colonic cell proliferation rate, and no clinically significant reduction of gastric emptying time or gastric acidity.</p>
<p>In addition, no effects on plasma triglyceride levels or systemic lipases were observed with the administration of XENICAL in these studies. In a 3-week study of 28 healthy male volunteers, XENICAL mg three times a day did not significantly affect the balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, copper, and iron. Pediatrics In a 3-week study of 32 obese adolescents aged 12 to 16 years, XENICAL mg three times a day did not significantly affect the balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, or copper.</p>
<p>The iron balance was decreased by  Dose-response Relationship A simple maximum effect Emax model was used to define the dose-response curve of the relationship between XENICAL daily dose and fecal fat excretion as representative of gastrointestinal lipase inhibition. The dose-response curve demonstrated a steep portion for doses up to approximately mg daily, followed by a plateau for higher doses. You should not take this medication if you are allergic to orlistat, if you are pregnant, or if you have gallbladder problems or chronic malabsorption syndrome an inability to absorb food and nutrients properly.</p>
<p>Before taking orlistat, tell your doctor if you have an underactive thyroid, a history of gallstones or pancreatitis, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, an eating disorder, liver or kidney disease, or if you take other weight-loss medications prescription or over-the-counter.</p>
<p>Do not give over-the-counter orlistat alli to a child younger than 18 years old. Prescription orlistat Xenical should not be used by anyone age 12 to 18 without the advice of a doctor. Orlistat should be used only by the person for whom it was prescribed. Very common 1 in 10 people or more: Oily or watery stool secretions, headache, abdominal pain, or increased bowel urgency.</p>

Using Xenical for weight loss Xenical mg capsules can help you lose weight as they contain orlistat which is a gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor and works by blocking the break down and absorption of dietary fat so that it cannot be used by your body for energy or stored as body fat.</p>
<p>If you keep to a low-fat, calorie-controlled diet and healthy lifestyle with lots of exercise, you should be able to lose weight and maintain weight loss which will also reduce the associated health risks of obesity.</p>
<p>What is the difference between Xenical and appetite suppressants? Xenical mg capsules work by targeting the digestion and absorption of dietary fat in your body rather than suppressing your appetite. Unlike appetite suppressants, Xenical is not absorbed into the blood but acts locally by binding to gastrointestinal lipase in your stomach.</p></p>
