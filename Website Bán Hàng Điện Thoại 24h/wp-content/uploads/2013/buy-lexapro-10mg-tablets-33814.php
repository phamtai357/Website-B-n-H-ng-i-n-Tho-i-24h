		<p><p>You should consult your doctor about using this drug if you have a history of drug abuse. You should not use this drug if you are allergic to this substance or any other ingredient of this drug. Consult your doctor before starting this drug if you suffer from kidney or liver disease. If you suffer from epilepsy or seizures, you should inform your doctor about it. This medication may induce suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>If you experience any such symptom, talk with your health care provider. Generic or Brand Lexapro may cause change in mood. The drug may cause problems in newborn babies, therefore this medication is not recommended for pregnant women without consulting the doctor first.</p>
<p>Same precaution should be undertaken if you are breastfeeding. Consult your doctor first before administering generic or brand Lexapro to a child younger than 12 years old. This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours.</p>
<p>If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this leaflet. These medicines act on the serotonin-system in the brain by increasing the serotonin level.</p>
<p>Disturbances in the serotonin-system are considered an important factor in the development of depression and related diseases. Escitalopram is used to treat: Depressive disorders episodes of a major depression Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia e. Please tell your doctor if you have any other condition or illness, as your doctor may need to take this into consideration.</p>
<p>In particular, tell your doctor if you: Your doctor may need to adjust your dosage have diabetes. Treatment with Escitalopram may alter glycaemic control. Please note Some patients with manic-depressive illness may enter into a manic phase. This is characterized by unusual and rapidly changing ideas, inappropriate happiness and excessive physical activity.</p>
<p>If you experience this, contact your doctor. Symptoms such as restlessness or difficulty to sit or stand still can also occur during the first weeks of the treatment. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms. These may be increased when first starting antidepressants, since these medicines all take time to work, usually about two weeks but sometimes longer.</p>
<p>You may be more likely to think like this: If you have previously had thoughts about killing or harming yourself If you are a young adult. Information from clinical trials has shown an increased risk of suicidal behaviour in adults aged less than 25 years with psychiatric conditions who were treated with an antidepressant If you have thoughts of harming or killing yourself at any time, contact your doctor or go to a hospital straight away.</p>
<p>You may find it helpful to tell a relative or close friend that you are depressed or have an anxiety disorder, and ask them to read this leaflet. You might ask them to tell you if they think your depression or anxiety is getting worse, or if they are worried about changes in your behaviour.</p>
<p>Children and adolescents Escitalopram should normally not be used for children and adolescents under 18 years. Also, you should know that patients under 18 have an increased risk of side effects such as suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts and hostility predominately aggression, oppositional behaviour and anger when they take this class of medicines.</p>
<p>If your doctor has prescribed Escitalopram for a patient under 18 and you want to discuss this, please go back to your doctor. You should inform your doctor if any symptoms listed above develop or worsen when patients under 18 are taking Escitalopram. Also, the long term safety effects concerning growth, maturation and cognitive and behavioural development of Escitalopram in this age group have not yet been demonstrated. Other medicines and Escitalopram Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions about this you should speak to your doctor. Tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: If you have taken any of these medicines you will need to wait 14 days before you start taking Escitalopram. These increase the risk of side effects The antibiotic linezolid Lithium used in the treatment of manic-depressive disorder and tryptophan Sumatriptan and similar medicines used to treat migraine and tramadol used against severe pain These increase the risk of side effects Cimetidine and omeprazole used to treat stomach ulcers , fluvoxamine antidepressant and ticlopidine used to reduce the risk of stroke.</p>
<p>These may cause increased blood levels of Escitalopram St. Your doctor will probably check the coagulation time of your blood when starting and discontinuing Escitalopram in order to verify that your dose of anti-coagulant is still adequate Mefloquin used to treat Malaria , bupropion used to treat depression and to help you quit smoking and tramadol used to treat severe pain due to a possible risk of a lowered threshold for seizures Neuroleptics medicines to treat schizophrenia, psychosis due to a possible risk of a lowered threshold for seizures, and antidepressants Flecainide, propafenone, and metoprolol used in cardio-vascular diseases desipramine, clomipramine, and nortriptyline antidepressants and risperidone, thioridazine, and haloperidol antipsychotics.</p>
<p>Ask your doctor for advice on these medicines. As with many medicines, combining Escitalopram with alcohol is not advisable, although Escitalopram is not expected to interact with alcohol. Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, plasma lithium levels should be monitored with appropriate adjustment to the lithium dose in accordance with standard clinical practice. Because lithium may enhance the serotonergic effects of escitalopram, caution should be exercised when Lexapro and lithium are coadministered.</p>
<p>Pimozide and Celexa - In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with racemic citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Racemic citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or Cmax of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known. Sumatriptan - There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of an SSRI and sumatriptan.</p>
<p>If concomitant treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI e. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of escitalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered. Ritonavir - Combined administration of a single dose of ritonavir mg , both a CYP3A4 substrate and a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, and escitalopram 20 mg did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either ritonavir or escitalopram.</p>
<p>However, coadministration of escitalopram 20 mg and ritonavir mg , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of escitalopram. Because escitalopram is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease escitalopram clearance.</p>
<p>In addition, steady state levels of racemic citalopram were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers after multiple-dose administration of citalopram, suggesting that coadministration, with escitalopram, of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6, is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on escitalopram metabolism.</p>
<p>However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for escitalopram, i. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of escitalopram and drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of Lexapro and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.</p>
<p>A no-effect dose for this finding was not established. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Mutagenesis Racemic citalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay Ames test in 2 of 5 bacterial strains Salmonella TA98 and TA in the absence of metabolic activation.</p>
<p>It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays. Slight maternal toxicity clinical signs and decreased body weight gain and food consumption was seen at this dose.</p>
<p>This dose was also associated with maternal toxicity clinical signs, decreased body weight gain. Thus, teratogenic effects of racemic citalopram were observed at a maternally toxic dose in the rat and were not observed in the rabbit. When female rats were treated with racemic citalopram 4. The no-effect dose was  A no-effect dose was not determined in that study.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, escitalopram should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Pregnancy-Nonteratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to Lexapro and other SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester, have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery.</p>
<p>Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. PPHN occurs in 1—2 per live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p>In a retrospective, case-control study of women whose infants were born with PPHN and women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy.</p>
<p>There is currently no corroborative evidence regarding the risk for PPHN following exposure to SSRIs in pregnancy; this is the first study that has investigated the potential risk.</p>
<p>Physicians should note that in a prospective longitudinal study of women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy, women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication. Labor and Delivery The effect of Lexapro on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Nursing Mothers Racemic citalopram, like many other drugs, is excreted in human breast milk.</p>
<p>There have been two reports of infants experiencing excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss in association with breastfeeding from a citalopram-treated mother; in one case, the infant was reported to recover completely upon discontinuation of citalopram by its mother and, in the second case, no follow-up information was available. The decision whether to continue or discontinue either nursing or Lexapro therapy should take into account the risks of citalopram exposure for the infant and the benefits of Lexapro treatment for the mother.</p>
<p>One placebo-controlled trial in pediatric patients with MDD has been conducted with Lexapro, and the data were not sufficient to support a claim for use in pediatric patients. Anyone considering the use of Lexapro in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need. The number of elderly patients in these trials was insufficient to adequately assess for possible differential efficacy and safety measures on the basis of age.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals to effects of Lexapro cannot be ruled out. Of patients in clinical studies of racemic citalopram, were 60 and over, were 65 and over, and were 75 and over.</p></p>
