How to store Co-amoxiclav Tablets 6. It contains two different medicines called amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.</p>
<p>The other active component clavulanic acid stops this from happening. Co-amoxiclav Tablets are used in adults and children to treat the following infections: If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Co-amoxiclav Tablets.</p>
<p>Warnings and Precautions Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Co-amoxiclav Tablets if you: If you are not sure if any of the above apply to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Co-amoxiclav Tablets. In some cases, your doctor may investigate the type of bacteria that is causing your infection. Depending on the results, you may be given a different strength of Co-amoxiclav Tablets or a different medicine. Conditions you need to look out for Co-amoxiclav Tablets can make some existing conditions worse, or cause serious side effects.</p>
<p>These include allergic reactions, convulsions fits and inflammation of the large intestine. You must look out for certain symptoms while you are taking Co-amoxiclav Tablets, to reduce the risk of any problems. Blood and urine tests If you are having blood tests such as red blood cell status tests or liver function tests or urine tests for glucose , let the doctor or nurse know that you are taking Co-amoxiclav Tablets.</p>
<p>This is because Co-amoxiclav Tablets can affect the results of these type of tests. Other medicines and Co-amoxiclav Tablets Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.</p>
<p>Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Driving and using machines Co-amoxiclav Tablets can have side effects and the symptoms may make you unfit to drive.</p>
<p>Do not drive or operate machinery unless you are feeling well. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.</p>
<p>Adults and children weighing 40 kg and over The usual dose is: Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice when giving Co-amoxiclav Tablets to children weighing less than 40 kg. The tablets are not suitable for children weighing less than 25 kg. During treatment with amoxicillin, enzymatic glucose oxidase methods should be used whenever testing for the presence of glucose in urine because false positive results may occur with non-enzymatic methods.</p>
<p>The presence of clavulanic acid in Augmentin may cause a non-specific binding of IgG and albumin by red cell membranes leading to a false positive Coombs test. However, in the literature there are cases of increased international normalised ratio in patients maintained on acenocoumarol or warfarin and prescribed a course of amoxicillin.</p>
<p>If co-administration is necessary, the prothrombin time or international normalised ratio should be carefully monitored with the addition or withdrawal of amoxicillin. Moreover, adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary see sections 4.</p>
<p>Methotrexate Penicillins may reduce the excretion of methotrexate causing a potential increase in toxicity. Probenecid Concomitant use of probenecid is not recommended.</p>
<p>Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concomitant use of probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin but not of clavulanic acid.</p>
<p>The change in pre-dose level may not accurately represent changes in overall MPA exposure. Therefore, a change in the dose of mycophenolate mofetil should not normally be necessary in the absence of clinical evidence of graft dysfunction. However, close clinical monitoring should be performed during the combination and shortly after antibiotic treatment. Use should be avoided during pregnancy, unless considered essential by the physician.</p>
<p>Breastfeeding Both substances are excreted into breast milk nothing is known of the effects of clavulanic acid on the breast-fed infant. Consequently, diarrhoea and fungus infection of the mucous membranes are possible in the breast-fed infant, so that breast-feeding might have to be discontinued.</p>
<p>The possibility of sensitisation should be taken into account. However, undesirable effects may occur e. Teva Pharmaceuticals Europe B. Galenika AD Srbolek A. Italija Instituto De Angeli S.
