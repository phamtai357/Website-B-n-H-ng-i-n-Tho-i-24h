            <h1>Doxycycline hyclate 50mg tablets - What conditions does Doxycycline Hyclate treat?</h1>
        </div>
	 
		<p><p>No abnormalities of thyroid function studies are known to occur. Dialysis does not alter serum half-life and thus would not be of benefit in treating cases of overdosage. In the management of more severe infections particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract , mg every 12 hours is recommended. For children above eight years of age: For children over lb the usual adult dose should be used. The therapeutic antibacterial serum activity will usually persist for 24 hours following recommended dosage.</p>
<p>When used in streptococcal infections, therapy should be continued for 10 days. Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to wash down the drugs and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. If gastric irritation occurs, it is recommended that doxycycline be given with food or milk. The absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk.</p>
<p>Studies to date have indicated that administration of doxycycline at the usual recommended doses does not lead to excessive accumulation of the antibiotic in patients with renal impairment. Uncomplicated gonococcal infections in adults except anorectal infections in men: As an alternate single visit dose, administer mg stat followed in one hour by a second mg dose.</p>
<p>The dose may be administered with food, including milk or carbonated beverage, as required. Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Bulging fontanels in infants and intracranial hypertension in adults. When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. No abnormalities of thyroid function studies are known to occur. Overdosage In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures.</p>
<p>Dialysis does not alter serum half-life and thus would not be of benefit in treating cases of overdosage. Doxycycline Hyclate Dosage and Administration The usual dosage and frequency of administration of doxycycline differs from that of the other tetracyclines. Exceeding the recommended dosage may result in an increased incidence of side effects. In the management of more severe infections particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract , mg every 12 hours is recommended. Pediatric Patients For all pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg with severe or life-threatening infections e.</p>
<p>Children weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose. For pediatric patients with less severe disease greater than 8 years of age and weighing less than 45 kg , the recommended dosage schedule is 4. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.</p>
<p>If such infections occur, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia , and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy.</p>
<p>Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize.</p>
<p>Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted.</p>
<p>Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize. Delayed Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg per kg every six hours.</p>
<p>This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus often related to retardation of skeletal development.</p>
<p>Evidence of embryotoxicity also has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Tetracycline-class drugs can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, but data for doxycycline are limited. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.</p>
<p>Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function. Incomplete Suppression of Malaria Doxycycline offers substantial but not complete suppression of the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium strains. Doxycycline does not suppress P. Subjects completing this prophylactic regimen may still transmit the infection to mosquitoes outside endemic areas.</p>
<p>Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing doxycycline hyclate in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.</p>
<p>Laboratory Monitoring for Long-Term Therapy In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic studies should be performed.</p>
<p>Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions have been identified during clinical trials or post-approval use of tetracycline-class drugs, including doxycycline. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, and inflammatory lesions with monilial overgrowth in the anogenital region.</p>
<p>Hepatotoxicity has been reported. Instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline-class. Hypersensitivity reactions Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, serum sickness, pericarditis, and exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus.</p>
<p>Blood Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Thyroid Gland Changes When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of thyroid glands. No abnormalities of thyroid function are known to occur. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage.</p>
<p>Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and iron-containing preparations. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by bismuth subsalicylate. Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of doxycycline. Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective.</p>
<p>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of doxycycline have not been conducted. However, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with the related antibacterial drugs, oxytetracycline adrenal and pituitary tumors , and minocycline thyroid tumors.</p>
<p>Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of doxycycline have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays have been reported for related antibacterial drugs tetracycline, oxytetracycline. Effect on male fertility has not been studied. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of doxycycline in pregnant women. The vast majority of reported experience with doxycycline during human pregnancy is short-term, first trimester exposure.</p>
<p>There are no human data available to assess the effects of long-term therapy of doxycycline in pregnant women, such as that proposed for treatment of anthrax exposure. An expert review of published data on experiences with doxycycline use during pregnancy by TERIS — the Teratogen Information System — concluded that therapeutic doses during pregnancy are unlikely to pose a substantial teratogenic risk the quantity and quality of data were assessed as limited to fair , but the data are insufficient to state that there is no risk8.</p>
<p>A case-control study 18, mothers of infants with congenital anomalies and 32, mothers of infants with no congenital anomalies shows a weak but marginally statistically significant association with total malformations and use of doxycycline anytime during pregnancy.</p></p>
