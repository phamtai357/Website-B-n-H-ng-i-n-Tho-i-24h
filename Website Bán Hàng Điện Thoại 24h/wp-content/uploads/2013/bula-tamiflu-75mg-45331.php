		<p><p>Side effects are usually temporary with continued treatment or disappear when you stop tacking the medicine. Before taking your medicine please read the patient information leaflet in detail to acquaint yourself with the potential side effects. If you have any questions or concerns, please speak to your GP in the first instance. Alternatively, contact our Online Clinic team for further assistance. Please read all packaging before taking Tamiflu. Side Effects of Tamiflu: Rare but serious skin reactions and allergic reactions have been reported.</p>
<p>Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. The pharmacological activity of Voltaren in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</p>
<p>This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including Voltaren, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia. NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible.</p>
<p>Patients receiving Voltaren who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.</p>
<p>Preexisting Asthma Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal.</p>
<p>Since cross-reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, Voltaren should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in patients with preexisting asthma.</p>
<p>Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy.</p>
<p>Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Voltaren, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, more serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death.</p>
<p>Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation.</p>
<p>Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians. Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity e.</p>
<p>Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactic reaction e. In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, Voltaren should be avoided because it will cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Laboratory Tests Because serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, physicians should monitor for signs or symptoms of GI bleeding.</p>
<p>If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver or renal disease develop, systemic manifestations occur e. When Voltaren is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of diclofenac and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.</p>
<p>NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Voltaren, like other NSAIDs, may affect renal prostaglandins and increase the toxicity of certain drugs.</p>
<p>Caution should be used when Voltaren is administered concomitantly with cyclosporine. Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that Voltaren can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.</p>
<p>The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.</p>
<p>Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors e. Pregnancy Category C Reproductive studies conducted in rats and rabbits have not demonstrated evidence of developmental abnormalities. However, animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response.</p>
<p>There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system closure of ductus arteriosus , use during pregnancy particularly late pregnancy should be avoided.

For children, the dosage is often lower. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continued therapy.
