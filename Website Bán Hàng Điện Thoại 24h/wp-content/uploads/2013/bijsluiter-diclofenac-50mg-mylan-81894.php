		<p><p>Take diclofenac exactly as your doctor tells you to. Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you how much to take and how often to take it. You may be asked to take just one dose a day, or several doses each day.</p>
<p>This information will also be printed on the label of the pack to remind you. As a general rule, taking diclofenac with a glass of milk or after eating some food can help to reduce side-effects such as indigestion.</p>
<p>On the label of your pack there will be instructions to tell you how to take the type you have been given. Read and follow the directions on the label carefully. If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If when you remember, it is nearly time for your next dose then take your next dose when it is due but leave out the missed dose.</p>
<p>Do not take two doses together to make up for a forgotten dose. Getting the most from your treatment Your doctor will try to prescribe you the lowest dose for the shortest time in order to reduce the risk of side-effects.</p>
<p>If you need to take diclofenac for a long time, your doctor may want to prescribe another medicine along with it to protect your stomach from irritation. Try to keep any regular appointments with your doctor.</p>
<p>This is so your doctor can check on your progress, and is especially important if you are taking diclofenac for a long-term condition. Do not crush, chew, split, or break extended-release tablets. Powder for oral solution: Gel Diclofenac gel is to be applied to the skin twice daily for 60 to 90 days.</p>
<p>Use exactly as prescribed. Do not use more or less of it, or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. In clinical trials, meaningful elevations i. In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3, patients treated for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1, patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic.</p>
<p>Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations. In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</p>
<p>Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. Physicians should measure transaminases periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms.</p>
<p>The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. To minimize the possibility that hepatic injury will become severe between transaminase measurements, physicians should inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity e.</p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac potassium, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Caution should be exercised in prescribing diclofenac potassium with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic e. Anaphylactic Reactions As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactic reactions may occur both in patients with the aspirin triad and in patients without known sensitivity to NSAIDs or known prior exposure to diclofenac potassium tablets.</p>
<p>Diclofenac potassium tablets should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. Anaphylaxis-type reactions have been reported with NSAID products, including with diclofenac products, such as diclofenac potassium tablets.</p>
<p>Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactic reaction occurs. These serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Pregnancy In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, diclofenac potassium tablets should be avoided because they may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.</p>
<p>Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function. Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity see the pemetrexed prescribing information.</p>
<p>NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives e. In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives e.</p>
<p>Co-administration of diclofenac with CYP2C9 inhibitors e. A 2-year carcinogenicity study conducted in mice employing diclofenac sodium at doses up to 0. Mutagenesis Diclofenac sodium did not show mutagenic activity in in vitro point mutation assays in mammalian mouse lymphoma and microbial yeast, Ames test systems and was nonmutagenic in several mammalian in vitro and in vivo tests, including dominant lethal and male germinal epithelial chromosomal studies in mice, and nucleus anomaly and chromosomal aberration studies in Chinese hamsters.</p>
<p>Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation.</p>
<p>Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility. Pregnancy Risk Summary Use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arterious. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets in pregnant women.</p>
<p>Data from observational studies regarding potential embryofetal risks of NSAID use in women in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy are inconclusive. In the general U. In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of teratogenicity was observed in mice, rats, or rabbits given diclofenac during the period of organogenesis at doses up to approximately 0.</p>
<p>Based on animal data, prostaglandins have been shown to have an important role in endometrial vascular permeability, blastocyst implantation, and decidualization. In animal studies, administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors such as diclofenac, resulted in increased pre- and post-implantation loss. These maternally toxic doses were associated with dystocia, prolonged gestation, reduced fetal weights and growth, and reduced fetal survival.</p>
<p>Diclofenac has been shown to cross the placental barrier in mice, rats, and humans. Labor or Delivery There are no studies on the effects of diclofenac sodium delayed-release tablets during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including diclofenac, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.</p>
<p>Nursing Mothers Risk Summary Based on available data, diclofenac may be present in human milk. Diclofenac has a low to moderate preference to block the COX2-isoenzyme approximately fold and is said to have, therefore, a somewhat lower incidence of gastrointestinal complaints than noted with indomethacin and aspirin. Some evidence indicates it inhibits the lipoxygenase pathways,[ citation needed ] thus reducing formation of the leukotrienes also pro-inflammatory autacoids.</p>
<p>It also may inhibit phospholipase A2 as part of its mechanism of action. These additional actions may explain its high potency - it is the most potent NSAID on a broad basis. In practice, use of some COX-2 inhibitors with their adverse effects has led to massive numbers of patient family lawsuits alleging wrongful death by heart attack , yet other significantly COX-selective NSAIDs, such as diclofenac, have been well tolerated by most of the population.</p>
<p>Blockage of voltage-dependent sodium channels after activation of the channel, diclofenac inhibits its reactivation also known as phase inhibition [ citation needed ] Blockage of acid-sensing ion channels ASICs [28] Positive allosteric modulation of KCNQ- and BK-potassium channels diclofenac opens these channels, leading to hyperpolarization of the cell membrane [ citation needed ] Main article: The mechanism is presumed to be renal failure , [30] however toxicity may be due to direct inhibition of uric acid secretion in vultures.</p>
<p>At a meeting of the National Wildlife Board in March , the Government of India announced it intended to phase out the veterinary use of diclofenac.</p></p>
