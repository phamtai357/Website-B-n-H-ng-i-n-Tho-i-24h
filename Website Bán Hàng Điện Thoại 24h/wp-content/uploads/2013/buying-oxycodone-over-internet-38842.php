		<p><p>Always check with your doctor before taking any kind of supplement. What I do here at SupplementCritique. I struggled for awhile on whether or not I wanted to publish this post to my readers. I care about my visitors, and they deserve to get the best information possible. Each time I was prescribed a pain killer, and each time I took it until there was nothing left in the bottle.</p>
<p>The feeling I got from them was exactly what you would expect. So, why not try and search around for something that could make me feel better?? Well, I finally found something that does just that. Native to most of Southeast Asia, Mitragyna speciosa korth or Kratom is a tropical deciduous and evergreen tree in the coffee family. Well my primary care doctor was really mad at me we had a disagreement about a Medical procedure he wanted me to go through and I Didnt want to do the procedure because it couldve en I went to Florida on vacation this year he decided to take all my medication away from me.</p>
<p>Having mild symptoms of withdrawal but nothing unmanageable. Does anyone know what is the best way to do this last step? Is it likely that I will still face more severe withdrawal symptoms when I stop completely? I Started taking more than prescribed. Now I need more just to function. So I decided to stop the oxy. Now the withdrawal is insane and I only stopped the oxy not the vicodin. I want all out of my system.</p>
<p>I can barely write this or even function with just 3 vicodin in my system and I am dropping that down to 2 vicodin today. So right now I feel like total crap. They did not however advise me to get treatment;find treatment or give me help other than just to cut back. Your website helped by letting me know at least what was and did happen to my body when stopping on my own. Thanks to your advise I am now finally almost off this drug.</p>
<p>Do think depression sets in. The thought of failing to stop is not me. Am I doing this wrong by going a day clean then a top up or is this just easing the withdrawal….</p>
<p>In which lasted exactly ten days straight none stop demonic feelings of all sorts i would never in my life wish on my worst enemy. Anyhow, my problem is that i cannot get hold of anymore and had my last one today, and now im panicking about once its gonna wear off and i start suffering the concequenses once again. God im such an idiot. Anyone who has wanted or is wanting to use such a tablet, should really ask around from people who know the addiction and have experienced this withdrawal.</p>
<p>And lasts for ten to fifteen days straight. OH and i lost too much weight over ten days that i was almost anorexic. Good on you matey, I really hope u can do this. Not to rush it or mess up the system u have going on. Man ive had some demonic cold turkey detoxing days myself and wouldnt wish it on my worse enemy mate hey!</p>
<p>But from to i have had 15 surgeries and when i woke up from the last one they said my pancreis gave out from so many surgies. Well about two years ago i hurt my shoulder and started taking vicodine the and the last 6 months i have been taking the immediate rel tabs oxycodone 5mg taking 30mg a day for the last couple of days and wanna slowly stop taking them and with the type one will it be harder cause i now any thing that happens to me now like getting sick my sugars go through the roof so i am assuming coming off the painkillers will be harder and will it take longer to come off them let me no please need to save my family.</p>
<p>Ive only just learnt how to check out different sites on my computer, and these ones are the best thing i couldve stumbled upon. I feel so sorry for all us people with addictions, because ive experienced withdrawal big time myself. It does take some of the discomfort away. Good luck to us all on getting well hey.</p>
<p>Well silly way to do it, Cos im suffering now from both, and… ive used meth for 23yrs and oxys for approx 11yrs. Ive got bad trembles in hands and legs, OH, not to mention chills and sweaty same time. I cannot stop my legs from moving around aggitated, its driving me crazy.</p>
<p>My body is aching constantly, and will for days on end too. I got ten panadeine fortes today by about 4. I am feeling prob about a quarter better. So i hope someone will some day comment on doing that them selves, Because that would make me a very happy woman for at least helping a little…… Good luck ANYONE….</p>
<p>First one tablet would get me super high then without realizing I started taking 2 sometimes 3 a day. My pain management doctor does not know about this. As of a few days I have started to get withdrawal symptoms after 8 hours of taking the roxies that before would keep me pain free and YES high for 24 hours or more.</p>
<p>And how many more than 3 a day would I have to take? And also my psychiatrist has me on Tofranil mlg for depression and anxiety. Would the Tofranil help? I appreciate information that can help me stop taking the roxies. I am a mom and cannot keep doing this. They were not bad enough. It told me to get off OxyCodone. I was on 5 pills a day 15 mg. I am having mild diarrhea,feeling alittle light headed so how many weeks does it take to get out of your system?</p>
<p>Does anyone know the best way to totally stop? Should I wean down to only one 2. I have been taking oxycodone 5mg tabs each night with 2 panamax tabs for the pain as there is nerve damage and union of one bone is not complete. Should I continue taking these tabs at night so I can sleep? Never during the day always at night and never more than 25 once in a while 30mgs.</p>
<p>I have been on oxycodone 20 to 25 mgs every night since november  I want to be off this medication. I ran short last month and had to take 5mg half pill for two nights and had a very hard time functioning the whole weekend and sunday night at midnight I was at the pharmacy because the calender date would change, that was insane. Two weeks ago I started taking a 10 mg tab and a large half.</p>
<p>For the past week I am only taking a tab and a small half, approx 15mgs or slightly less. Will this work or should I see my doctor and ask for something to help. I would go to a rehab before withdrawals as I have been through them trying to stop in the past.</p>
<p>I really am serious about quitting and I want to take a sleeping pill for at least days. Please help Luis  I did it for my family. Be strong and you will come out. Remember not to celebrate too much you never know what can happen, walk out and be safe. I started taking percocets a year ago. Starting from once a month, to every other weekend, to every weekend, half the week, then to where I am presently, everyday now finding myself addicted no surprise here.</p>
<p>I tried to go cold turkey but suffered major withdrawals. Obviously, my body is physically dependent. My dilemma is this: It is a very social job. My team relies heavily on me to be on point. I cannot go cold turkey because the symptoms make me anti social, unmotivated, and completely useless, thus bringing my numbers down and put into question.</p>
<p>I would like to know if it is at all possible to taper down slowly where the withdrawals are absolutely minimum or none? As sad as it is to say, the withdrawals are too strong for me to go cold turkey without hindering my work life.</p>
<p>Is it possible to do this? If so, what is the proper dosage to taper down? Do I do them evenly throughout the day from wake to sleep?</p>
<p>How long should my taper be? I also have access to suboxone and have heard wonderful things. I was thinking I taper down to nearly nothing on the perks, and then take a few suboxones to minimize withdrawals. What do you think? I greatly appreciate anyone who is reading this and desperately plee for your expertise. Thank you for the help you will be giving me. My doc slowly took me down from 20 mg times per day plus fentanyl patch, mg. The oxy was different. Went to 15 mg.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have just had my entire lumbar spine from L 1 to tailbone fused and they are giving me dilaudid, so I am back where I started, maybe worse. The pain from surgery is dreadful but hopefully will pass and so will the dilaudid, reducing that. I get them from a third party. What do you recommend I do? What are the proper mg to taper off? I have heard going cold turkey is horribly painful, so personally—just my opinion—weening is best.</p>
<p>I had to go down so much so they could control my pain after my surgery which was 8 weeks ago. Good luck, you can do it. Try even NA—they are the experts! Also when I talked about reducting the amount of mg.</p>
<p>I meant to add that in my opinion only you should take that reduced mg and number of pills for a week or two and then reduce some more—do the weening slowly. I wonder if you went to a dr. I was given 10 my oxycodone every 4 hrs. While in the hospital. I now take 10mg every 6 to 8 hrs. It makes me very groggy. I know I have reduc the amount just have to take. What is the next way to do that Hannelore  I was on oxicoton 6 a day, for about 2 months now I am trying to lower my dose.</p>
<p>I am at 3 for the past 3 weeks and trying desperately to go down to just 2 a day. But it gets so uncomfortable the last few hours. I become depressed, angry at everybody and mean to my husband. I tried cutting them in half but that did not help it would only last for 1 hour and than the pain would start.</p>
<p>Would you have any ideas on what I could do? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Iwas at one point taking 15 ml tabs per month plus mlg fentenole patches. I have recently reduced my oxy to tabs per month but it was a difficult task and still on the fentinole ,I would like to stop completely any sugestions how to do this at home with minimal withdrals.</p>
<p>If I ease of of them, will I still go through withdrawal? I really just wish I never got into them and am wanting to start over but with no one noticing any change in me. I need to continue with my life. If you do a slow taper, you may experience some withdrawal discomfort, but nowhere near as adverse and intense as quitting cold turkey.</p>
<p>Actually, lowering doses gradually and slowly is the right way to get off of a medication without causing your body stress. Usually, the first 2 days are a little funky, then things get settled down.</p>
<p>So I need help on how i should stop cold turkey please thanx.. Im seeing pain management. Hes a new Dr for me. Im 45 going through perimenopause Hot flash my ass im sweating profusely and drinking plenty of fluids so I dont dehydrate. The Dr informed me my levels are low.</p>
<p>Im eating 10mg oxycodone, 60 10mg methadone and takke klonopin for the hesd trauma. Is it because of the perimenopause and all the fluid loss? Ivana Addiction Blog 2: He may have been referring to the tolerance that builds up in your system after you take medications for a period of time. After a while, your body gets used to the doses you take, so they no longer have the effectiveness they used to produce.</p>
<p>In order to get the same effects from the medications you will need to increase your doses. But, be careful because after a while you will get used to the increased doses, which makes it a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>Because of this I have finished my prescription ahead of time 2 days — I had 1 pill early this morning then spent the day getting scrip from my Dr. I occ take one. So I did take 1 bc I could feel myself anxious. I have been on this medication for prob 3 years so I think if I was inclined towards abuse it would have happened already. I am dizzy, already have night sweats from my illness so the Q is can I make it OK until my scrip is refilled?</p>
<p>My back required rods which were taken out but there was a subsequent fracture and longer rods were put in and left permanent since the surgeon felt there was so much scar damage the 4th surgery to remove the 2nd set of rods would be ore damaging than of benefit. So, I have been on various opiates prescriptions from Narco to oxycodone to oxycontin and various combinations for 9 years.</p>
<p>I am currently have been on the lowest daily dose of the 9 years of 10 mg pills of oxycodone for years. I have gone from taking 1 or 2 pills at a time to taking one 10 mg pill every 4 hours basically. That includes taking a pile during the early morning hours when I wake up uncomfortable. I have more pain in my shoulder and back but feel I must get off or at least reduce the dosage because I must go in for shoulder surgery in the next days to repair damage in the joint from the damage the lack of muscle control and normal shoulder action resulting from the nerve damage to that shoulder…… QUESTION — Should I try get off the oxy entirely before the shoulder surgery only to then go back on it?</p>
<p>Or is it a waste of effort since once i go back on Oxy for the surgery I will become dependent again only to have to go thru a second withdrawal? Will I become re-dependent really quick or easier since I have been so recently? Will the withdrawal the second time be more difficult than this first time? I feel like the mg daily dose should not have been this dependency forming but it appears it was now and I am embarrassed to talk to doctors or others regarding it because it does not seem to be a dose that should be of concern to get off.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate any help and comments you can provide. I am fine with all this being published if only to warn older patients on how easy I think it is now to become dependent I believe on even this low of a dose. I am not sure how though to make certain I can find or see any response you provide unless you send me something email helping me find the response. With sincere appreciation for any an all assistance you can provide.</p>
<p>My pain doctor helped me wean off slowly everything except Percocet 10 mg 4 times a day. I was on 20 mg 6 times a day. Plus I had a spinal stimulator implanted which was removed. I now have hundreds of leftover pills. Not sure what that means!! For last years I have been on mg daily via 10 mg pills taking 1 or 2 every hours.</p>
<p>I wanted try stay that low a daily dose but today sucks with nausea, hot cold flashes, tired, ache, tired etc…. Should I suck it up and expect be better in 24 hours or not?</p>
<p>How long till going from 60 mg per day to 15 before you feel normal again? I was taking 50 mg a day for 6 months. I did not have a major illness or major pain, I just had mild bursitis in my left shoulder from snowboarding injury. First two doctors would not prescribe knowing how addictive and dangerous it is. I doctor shopped until I found nice Doctor who prescribed for me. We cannot blame the Doctors or our government, we must accept blame for our addiction.</p>
<p>At first it is great, you feel euphoric and have so much energy to get things done. When I started to have withdrawals during sleep I knew I was addicted and in trouble. I would swallow 30mg then snort 20mg, the first thing is to stop all snorting or injecting. I took 10 30mg pills and crushed it into fine powder in pill grinder. For 2 weeks I would take a tiny flat head screwdriver and dip a small scoop of powder and swallow it chased down with ice water…I did this 4 times a day.</p>
<p>You should drink copious amounts of ice water all day to flush out the drugs. Now the hard part, you need to dedicate 14 days to kick this even if you have to take 2 weeks vacation from work. The first 72 hours is the worst as you will not sleep. You will have runny nose, diarhhea, stomach aches, cold sweats, hot flashes, muscle aches, joint pain, insomnia, anxiety, crying spells, no energy but worst of all is the restlessness and feeling your back is tingling and itching.</p>
<p>It helps to take hot showers. Most important thing is to flush down toilet ALL your pills! If I did not flush all my pills I would have taken them. I could not stand the metallic, brassy smell that permeated my entire home from this drug excreting from my skin.</p>
<p>There is some Thai herbal leaf that is supposed to help but I did not use it. If you have been addicted for over a year or take large doses you may need Suboxone or treatment center. Even now at night I still have tingly restlessness in back but not as bad. I also flushed away all my ambien and xanax pills as well. I did take up smoking again though.</p>
<p>Do not tell your family and friends about this, they will not understand your addiction, just quit and let it fade away. I called my doctors office and cancelled my refill prescription, I have no desire for this drug now. My shoulder hurts less now then when I was on this drug. I take ibuprophen and aspirin only now.</p>
<p>Do not start detox when you are in grip of withdrwal symptoms. Also during detox eat light healthy foods such as fruits and veggies, do not eat junk food or spicy food as it will upset your stomach. Drink plenty of ice water as it will help flush out the drugs. Also with heavy long time users it may take a month to detox but you can do it! I just started a new job 2 weeks ago and planning a vacation to Dominican Republic to celebrate without the pills! Once you quit take a vacation to celebrate your new life, you deserve it!</p>
<p>During the detox I went through depression and thoughts of suicide but please know those thoughts will go away once you are clean! Those who say they quit cold turkey with no problem either did not quit or they are machismo. But 2 — 4 weeks of hell is worth it to have the rest of your life back!</p>
<p>You MUST flush all the pills away. If you throw pills in trash you will just dig them back up. You will think I should have just kept one pill for emergency, but that pill will pull you back in! Tell your doctor you do not want any more painkillers. We have to manage life without using pills as a crutch. Also try to go outside and take a bike ride or walk every day. I am not here to brag, if I can do it then anyone can. I feel your dispair and sorrow, I went through it but it is only 2 weeks of hell to get the rest of your life back.</p>
<p>Get mad at this drug and know that it will not control your life from now on! Sound feasible to you? Ivana Addiction Blog  Of course, if you feel uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms, you can take it a bit slower.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I believe you are on a good path. After you completely stop taking your medication, some withdrawal effects may occur and you may need to be ready to treat them with over-the-counter medications and home remedies, or prescription meds.</p>
<p>Having spine with Bulging disc surgery on the 28th. All my doctors know I take oxycodone-acetaminophen  Been taking 3 pills in 24 hours. When should I cut back? I am worried about becoming addicted.</p>
<p>I also wonder if taking oxycodone for only part of each day might help avoid addiction. Do you know of any actual research on these questions? I have never had a substance abuse problem; the reasons for my liver disease are unclear.</p>
<p>The pain I am having is often pretty bad. It is not clear whether I will recover from my illnesses or die soon. On the other hand, if I may die in the next year or so anyway, then suffering through the pain is pointless. I wish I had a better idea of the actual risks of becoming addicted, and how to avoid them. However, it is much stressful to your organism to be experiencing such pain without taking anything to help you manage it. After your injury has healed and pain is gone, you can safely taper down with medical assistance.</p>
<p>After months regular dosage, cold turkey is not the best or most recommended method for going off Oxy. I suggest you get a tapering schedule and a list of medications that can help with withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for help around any issues. I have been taking Oxycodone 15mg three to four times a day. Recently I am recovering from another back surgery of 8 screws to stabilize the spine. I decided to try to come off the oxy.</p>
<p>I stopped the Oxycodone and Oxycotin 4 days ago and I do feel jittery and have cold sweats off and on. Should I just cut the pills a little at a time or is it okay to stay with the Tramadol???? I want to get off all medication as soon as possible and be pain free. I am 82 years old. Thank you for your input in this matter. No longer slave to Oxycontin 3: Also have significant neck pain.</p>
<p>I started to have diarrhea last summer with incontinence and attributed this to cervical myelopathy. My head was cloudy and I had no energy, I decided not to take this medication any longer so I quit cold turkey January 6,  I had horrific stomach cramps which I bound my abdomen with ace wraps, severe restless legs, No Sleep.</p>
<p>My head is finally clear although I am still having poor sleep which is so difficult. Finally getting some sleep. No matter how much pain I have I vowed I will never subject my body to this horrific drug. I am praying sleep will return to normal soon. Keep up the positive thinking and dedication. Thank you for sharing a positive story that will encourage other who are going through the same. No longer slave to oxycontin 6: Imagine that this receptor site is a keyhole.</p>
<p>Opiates are the key that turn it on. Buprenorphine is the opiate-mimicking agent, while the chemical naloxone will block the effects of any other opiates taken. The naloxone acts as a deterrent to abusing illicit opiates while undergoing Suboxone treatment. Subutex Subutex is much like Suboxone, but there is one difference. Methadone This is the most powerful ORM and has been around the longest.</p>
<p>All of these medications can work well for getting off oxycodone if used correctly, though there still remain pros and cons just like any other option.</p>
<p>Pros Much less expensive than detox; usually a few hundred to several hundred dollars per month. Covered to varying degrees by different insurance plans. They allow you to continue going to work and taking care of family responsibilities.</p>
<p>They can reduce or eliminate withdrawal symptoms and cravings. I take pills a month, i went to detox 2 times stayed 1 week came home next morning very sick, had to start my pills again cause i was so sick and could not take anymore than 1 week off of work! My question is how long do i have to be in detox to be not in pain or can i wern myself Terry 7: Will sorting one none and then when you are hurting real bad is that bad for you???</p>
<p>Lydia Addiction Blog  Oxycodone withdrawal may last from couple of hours to several days. It all depends on the doses administered, body itself, the period of time the medication was consumed, etc. Is three days at this dose likely to cause withdrawal symptoms?</p>
<p>If so, will it still take a week to get over it, or will it take less time? I have a few pills left. Should I break them in half and maybe try taking half in the morning and half at bedtime?</p>
<p>Or am I getting all worried for nothing? I am now taking 1 5 mg pill every 8 to 10 hrs. Feel nauseous for a lot of the day.</p>
<p>Could this be a symptom of withdrawal Sherri 4: I was put on Methadone in when my Dr. I had no idea at the time what I was being given until I heard about a lot of overdosing on it. Went from 40 mg a day 2 mg tabs twice a day to 60 mg a day at mg pills 3 times a day. Did this for 10 years. Had to get anti-nausea pills from my Dr. On August 18th was my last percocet and I am now pill free. I have a relationship with Jesus Christ and I am sure that made all the difference.</p>
<p>You feel so sick you think you are dying but you are not. Talk to your Dr. Hang in there because it is worth it. I believe you are going to experience withdrawal symptoms even if you are only on pain killers for a short time.</p>
<p>I now have to tolerate my back pain but I feel so much better. More clarity, no nodding off, etc. You can do it. How many days after the 10th April will this stop. Kind Regards Sherri  I was reading some of the latter blogs, etc and I just want to say that my experience was weening off from March through August  Whatever the number of tabs are, doses, etc.</p>
<p>Very nauseated, trouble sleeping, trouble eating force yourself to eat even if it is a piece of toast or jello. Checked for dehydration, etc. Still wake up during the night, restless but I think that is due to pain but could still be from being on meds for so many years. Never take any meds just because a Dr. Hope this helps someone. Will the depression go away if I stay off tgem for good? I literally have no motivation to do anything!!!</p>
<p>I basically just lay on the couch extremely depressed and miserable!! Please tell me I will be happy and my brain will go back to normal and I can be happy and productive again if I stay off them for good. Usully just 10 mg day, but now I stopped it because of constipation problems and I have severe diarrhea, weakness, loss of appetite, etc. Is that a result of stopping the oxy? Thank you in advance for your answer.</p>
<p>Now I have very deprested and I feel like crying a lot Can you help me out with this problem and tell how long dose these feelings last. Thanking you ester 3: Now at home took 2 5mg every 4 to 6 hrs max 8 or 10 per 24 hr. As of yesterday 7: I believe im having withdrawal symptoms. How long it it be for?? I was up to 90 mgs. I have had none for 55 hours. Just now starting to feel better. Muscle aches are down , they were severe, however my BP is way up. Can I safely withdraw from this by myself?</p>
<p>Lydia Addiction Blog 4: I suggest you speak with your doctor who can help you plan an individualized tapering schedule. Experts clam that slowly reducing the drug is a safer way to quit it. Starting today I went down to 1 perc 7. After surgery, every 3 hours I received pain meds. Every other three hours was a shot and the other times was a pill. After release from the hospital I was in a lot of pain. Turns out I had spinal leakage and they had to have another surgery to repair the: Again after surgery for aapprox 5 days, I was given pain meds every 3 hours or so.</p>
<p>I literally thought I was dying. I never experienced anything so debilitating like that. However, these night sweats and interrupted sleep have remained. Can the night-sweat withdrawal symptoms still be lingering? My primary care physician kind of tipped his hat to me. He told me that after such a surgery only then to have gone through the cold turkey, that I was quite strong. He totally understood what I was going through. Told me to anticipate lingering symptoms.</p>
<p>Again, can these night-sweats and nightly sleep interruption last this long? Also, other than that, I take absolutely no meds. Not a big drinker at all and indulge in no drugs at all. I eat relatively healthy and drink water only. Could such a profound amount of oxycondone in a relatively small period of time be the cause of the lingering effects; night sweats and therefore interrupted sleep for now two weeks after I stopped taking the oxy?</p>
<p>I could not eat. Could barely stand at the toilet. I thought I would crumble to the floor. Also, it depressed you profoundly. Thank you… Dave 9: Almost my entire spine is herniated and I successfully reduced my dosage from above 80 to 20 when recently I was hit by a car. I was raised back up to 40 for 6 months and was abruptly cut off when my auto insurance ran out and was told they no longer accept my HMO.</p>
<p>I was given a weaning dose of 54 10mg tablets of oxy ir. Well all was going well when my pcp refused to ok my treatment. I have since been hospitalized with a severe upper GI bleed 2nd time that they can find no cause for after endoscopy ct scan MRI and ultra sound.</p>
<p>Im suffering also from nonalcoholic liver damage. I have a business a wife and daughter who are freaked out. I have done everything right including requesting the lowering of my dose over the years. I go to my lawyer tomorrow to take steps in the event that their combined actions lead to my death.</p>
<p>What is wrong with this country.</p></p>
