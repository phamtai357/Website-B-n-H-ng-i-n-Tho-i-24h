		<p><p>In some cases, paradoxical effects can occur with benzodiazepines, such as increased hostility, aggression, angry outbursts, and psychomotor agitation. These effects are seen more commonly with lorazepam than with other benzodiazepines. Frustrating stimuli may trigger such reactions, though the drug may have been prescribed to help the patient cope with such stress and frustration in the first place.</p>
<p>As paradoxical effects appear to be dose-related, they usually subside on dose reduction or on complete withdrawal of lorazepam. Benzodiazepines are associated with increased risk of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition. Among benzodiazepines, lorazepam has relatively strong amnesic effects, [28] [52] but patients soon develop tolerance to this with regular use. This also applies to use for night sedation.</p>
<p>High-dose or prolonged parenterally administered lorazepam is sometimes associated with propylene glycol poisoning. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. June Learn how and when to remove this template message Lorazepam should be avoided in people with: Allergy or hypersensitivity — Past hypersensitivity or allergy to lorazepam, to any benzodiazepine, or to any of the ingredients in lorazepam tablets or injections Severe respiratory failure — Benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, may depress central nervous system respiratory drive and are contraindicated in severe respiratory failure.</p>
<p>An example would be the inappropriate use to relieve anxiety associated with acute severe asthma. The anxiolytic effects may also be detrimental to a patient's willingness and ability to fight for breath. However, if mechanical ventilation becomes necessary, lorazepam may be used to facilitate deep sedation. Acute intoxication — Lorazepam may interact synergistically with the effects of alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances. It should, therefore, not be administered to a drunk or intoxicated person.</p>
<p>Ataxia — This is a neurological clinical sign, consisting of unsteady and clumsy motion of the limbs and torso, due to the failure of gross muscle movement coordination, most evident on standing and walking. It is the classic way in which acute alcohol intoxication may affect a person. Benzodiazepines should not be administered to already-ataxic patients. Acute narrow-angle glaucoma — Lorazepam has pupil-dilating effects, which may further interfere with the drainage of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye, thus worsening narrow-angle glaucoma.</p>
<p>Sleep apnea — Sleep apnea may be worsened by lorazepam's central nervous system depressant effects. It may further reduce the patient's ability to protect his or her airway during sleep. Pregnancy and breast feeding — Lorazepam belongs to the Food and Drug Administration FDA pregnancy category D, which means it is likely to cause harm to the developing baby if taken during the first trimester of pregnancy.</p>
<p>The evidence is inconclusive whether lorazepam if taken early in pregnancy results in reduced intelligence, neurodevelopmental problems, physical malformations in cardiac or facial structure, or other malformations in some newborns.</p>
<p>Lorazepam given to pregnant women antenatally may cause floppy infant syndrome [55] in the neonate, or respiratory depression necessitating ventilation. Regular lorazepam use during late pregnancy the third trimester , carries a definite risk of benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate. Neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal may include hypotonia , reluctance to suck, apneic spells, cyanosis , and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress.</p>
<p>Symptoms of floppy infant syndrome and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome have been reported to persist from hours to months after birth. Lorazepam is present in breast milk, so caution must be exercised about breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Specific groups[ edit ] Children and the elderly — The safety and effectiveness of lorazepam is not well determined in children under 18 years of age, but it is used to treat acute seizures.</p>
<p>Dose requirements have to be individualized, especially in the elderly and debilitated patients in whom the risk of oversedation is greater. Long-term therapy may lead to cognitive deficits, especially in the elderly, which may only be partially reversible.</p>
<p>The elderly metabolize benzodiazepines more slowly than younger people and are more sensitive to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines compared to younger individuals even at similar plasma levels. Additionally, the elderly tend to take more drugs which may interact or enhance the effects of benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>Benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, have been found to increase the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly. As a result, dosage recommendations for the elderly are about half of those used in younger individuals and used for no longer than two weeks. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported.</p>
<p>The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete, tolerance develops to these impairments. Like oxazepam , it does not require hepatic oxidation, but only hepatic glucuronidation into lorazepam-glucuronide. Therefore, impaired liver function is unlikely to result in lorazepam accumulation to an extent causing adverse reactions.</p>
<p>Staff must use chaperones to guard against allegations of abuse during treatment. Such allegations may arise because of incomplete amnesia, disinhibition, and impaired ability to process cues. Because of its relative long duration of residual effects sedation , ataxia , hypotension , and amnesia , lorazepam premedication is best suited for hospital inpatient use.</p>
<p>Patients should not be discharged from the hospital within 24 hours of receiving lorazepam premedication unless accompanied by a caregiver. An insulin push might be a more sensible choice. Blood insulin inhalers ought to be readily available in the near future.</p>

<p>The beaches are superb, most of them awarded the Blue Flag. Cortisol is measured in the basal samples from all sites and in all the peripheral samples. Prolactin is measured in both IPS series. Pituitary ACTHomas are usually paramedian or lateral and there is suppression of the normal corticotrophs on the contralateral side Crooke cell changes.</p>
<p>It has also been reported that prolactin and GH are often raised on the side of the tumour and that this is augmented by CRF. Jugular venous samples do not consistently show lateralisation. The measurement of prolactin can be used as a marker of proximity to the pituitary. The interpretation of the CRF test at present is uncertain as the reported series use different end points, varying doses of CRF and small numbers of patients. Until there is more local experience see above of this test it should not be used to differentiate sources of ACTH.</p>
<p>Clinical Endocrinology 25,  NEJM ,  Take care in patients with severe depression or hypomania. Again implants can cause problems.</p>
<p>This is an inpatient test and should only be performed after at least 2 baseline values for 24 hour urinary free cortisol and h cortisol and ACTH levels see below. During the test the patient takes 2 mg dexamethasone p. Suppression with high dose dexamethasone is usually seen in Cushing's disease but not in ectopic ACTH production or adrenal tumours.</p>
<p>These patients are very hard to differentiate from Cushing's disease. The h cortisol after 48 hours is considered to be the best parameter to use to discriminate between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH. In difficult cases it is advisable to repeat the test as no patients with an adrenal tumour have been shown to have reproducible suppression and cases of Cushing's syndrome may show cyclical variation.</p>
<p>The merits of starting each patient on cortisol-lowering medication should be discussed first, preferably via the pituitary MDT, since these agents may make early post-operative assessment of cortisol difficult.</p></p>
