		<p><p>How will Ivermectin work in my body? How should Ivermectin be taken? How to reduce the risk of Ivermectin drug interactions and side effects? Note The health and medical information provided here is intended to supplement and not substitute for the expertise and judgment of your physician, pharmacists or other health care professional. It should not be understood to indicate that the use of Ivermectin is safe, appropriate or effective for you.</p>
<p>Always consult your health care professional before using this, or any other, drug. However, at 3 and 6 months after the dose, a significantly greater percentage of patients treated with Stromectol had decreases in microfilariae count in the anterior chamber than patients treated with placebo.</p>
<p>Indications and Usage for Stromectol Stromectol is indicated for the treatment of the following infections: Strongyloidiasis of the intestinal tract. Stromectol is indicated for the treatment of intestinal i. Stromectol is indicated for the treatment of onchocerciasis due to the nematode parasite Onchocerca volvulus.</p>
<p>This indication is based on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and comparative studies conducted in patients in onchocerciasis-endemic areas of West Africa. The comparative studies used diethylcarbamazine citrate DEC-C. Stromectol has no activity against adult Onchocerca volvulus parasites.</p>
<p>The adult parasites reside in subcutaneous nodules which are infrequently palpable. Surgical excision of these nodules nodulectomy may be considered in the management of patients with onchocerciasis, since this procedure will eliminate the microfilariae-producing adult parasites. Contraindications Stromectol is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product. These reactions are probably due to allergic and inflammatory responses to the death of microfilariae.</p>
<p>Patients treated with Stromectol for onchocerciasis may experience these reactions in addition to clinical adverse reactions possibly, probably, or definitely related to the drug itself. The treatment of severe Mazzotti reactions has not been subjected to controlled clinical trials.</p>
<p>Precautions General After treatment with microfilaricidal drugs, patients with hyperreactive onchodermatitis sowda may be more likely than others to experience severe adverse reactions, especially edema and aggravation of onchodermatitis.</p>
<p>Rarely, patients with onchocerciasis who are also heavily infected with Loa loa may develop a serious or even fatal encephalopathy either spontaneously or following treatment with an effective microfilaricide. Once in the host intestine, the larvae mature into adults and produce eggs, which hatch and the next generation of larvae are excreted in the faeces or migrate to other parts of the body and thereby reinfect the same host.</p>
<p>Symptoms of strongyloidiasis include a rash at the site of larval penetration, usually the feet, gastrointestinal symptoms diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting ; other symptoms include low-grade fever, coughing and wheezing, due to the migration of larvae through the lungs.</p>
<p>Severe infection can be more serious if the parasite spreads throughout the body. Stromectol tablets 3mg are also used to treat lymphatic filariasis, also known as elephantiasis caused by the thread-like nematode worm Wuchereria bancrofti carried by mosquitos. Transmission is by a bite from and infected mosquito when the larvae enter the blood stream and migrate to the lymph vessels.</p>
<p>They mature into adults, mate and produce and microfilariae, which circulate in the blood ready to infect when another mosquito bites, where they grow into adults and begin the life cycle again.</p>
<p>Symptoms of lymphatic filariasis include lymphoedema or obstruction of the lymphatic system causing swelling in the arms, legs or genitals, which can be painful and disfiguring.</p>
<p>Stromectol tablets 3mg are also used to treat scabies, after prior treatment has failed. Scabies is a contagious parasitic infection, caused by the parasitic mite Sarcoptes scabiei, which is transmitted by direct skin contact. The scabies mite burrows into the skin causing itching as it burrows, which can be intense and is often worse at night.</p>
<p>Within two to six weeks after infection the mite can cause an allergic reaction with symptoms including a rash, seen as small red bumps on the limbs and trunk, which are usually very itchy; also nodules in the groin or armpit. Control of extra-intestinal strongyloidiasis in these patients is difficult, and suppressive therapy, i. Body as a Whole: Changes observed were primarily deterioration from baseline 3 days post-treatment. Most changes either returned to baseline condition or improved over baseline severity at the month 3 and 6 visits.</p>
<p>The percentages of patients with worsening of the following conditions at day 3, month 3 and 6, respectively, were: The corresponding percentages for patients treated with placebo were: However, these were the most common adverse experiences reported overall during these trials regardless of causality  A similar safety profile was observed in an open study in pediatric patients ages 6 to  These have rarely been severe or associated with loss of vision and have generally resolved without corticosteroid treatment.</p>
<p>Post-Marketing Experience for All Indications The following adverse reactions have been reported since the drug was registered overseas: At these doses, the treatment-related signs that were observed in these animals include ataxia, bradypnea, tremors, ptosis, decreased activity, emesis, and mydriasis.</p>
<p>In accidental intoxication with, or significant exposure to, unknown quantities of veterinary formulations of ivermectin in humans, either by ingestion, inhalation, injection, or exposure to body surfaces, the following adverse effects have been reported most frequently:</p></p>
