You can cut a tablet with a knife and crush it, if necessary, with the back of a spoon. Depending on how much medication you wish to take, a. How to mix the liquid If you want to make your own liquid you may not need to crush the pill.</p>
<p>I don't recommend it, because small amounts are lost as powder. First just try putting it in water and see if the pill dissolves on its own. It may take a little while, my one that's coated takes about ten minutes.</p>
<p>If it doesn't dissolve in water then try to crush it directly in the container that you're going to be adding water to, so powder won't be lost. Alternatively, if your medication is in tablet form, you can cut the tablet up into rough quarters with a pill cutter or knife crush the tablet into powder using a pill crusher or mortar and pestle cut it up and carefully crush it with the back of a spoon on a piece of waxed paper If your medication is a powder in a capsule, carefully open the capsule above the container and pour the contents into the bottom of the container.</p>
<p>To open a capsule, grasp each end in your fingers and gently twist. The capsule should come apart in the middle. Do this over the open container, to catch the powder in the container. Measure the water or pharmacy liquid With an oral syringe: Draw room temperature not hot, not cold water into an oral syringe and convey it to the container. A 10mL 10cc or 20mL 20cc oral syringe is handy for this purpose. With a graduated cylinder: For example, if you wish to make 30mL of a solution, fill the graduated cylinder to the 30mL mark and pour it into the container.</p>
<p>With a cc mL medicine bottle: Fill carefully to the cc or mL line. You'll have to bring the bottle up to your eye level to do this. Please note the measurements on these bottles are less exact than the graduated cylinder. To mix, put the cap on the container, tightly, and shake it gently. For example, a buyer must pay closing costs typically five percent of the loan amount and real estate agent commission typically six percent of the loan amount before being called a homeowner.</p>
<p>We did not pay a dime of any of these when we bought our house and the price we paid was roughly equal to the assessed value. Initial costs aside, there are also other costs a buyer is responsible for that a renter is not, such as mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance and maintenance. These costs can add up and may even increase significantly over the years.</p>
<p>Plus, renters also have to actually pay the rent, which is akin to the mortgage interest discussed above. At best, buyers have depreciating assets. Home prices are falling in nearly every area of the country. An estimated 50 percent of the buyers whose loans were originated after now owe more than their homes are worth. Homeowners who have been paying on their homes for ten years or more are seeing their equity disappear. In fact, based on home sales in my area, prices have held steady or perhaps gone up slightly in the last year.</p>
<p>First of all, there seems to be some sort of implication that a renter is better off because they may have assets of some sort, which apparently include Star Wars collectibles. This is true of homeowners as well — anyone with stuff can liquidate that stuff if need be.</p></p>
