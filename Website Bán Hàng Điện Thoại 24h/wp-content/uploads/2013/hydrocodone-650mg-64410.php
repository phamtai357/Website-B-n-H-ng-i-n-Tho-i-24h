		<p><p>Tell your doctor about all medications you use. This includes prescription, over-the-counter, vitamin, and herbal products. Do not start a new medication without telling your doctor. Where can I get more information? Your pharmacist can provide more information about acetaminophen and hydrocodone. Remember, keep this and all other medicines out of the reach of children, never share your medicines with others, and use this medication only for the indication prescribed. Every effort has been made to ensure that the information provided by Cerner Multum, Inc.</p>
<p>Drug information contained herein may be time sensitive. Multum information has been compiled for use by healthcare practitioners and consumers in the United States and therefore Multum does not warrant that uses outside of the United States are appropriate, unless specifically indicated otherwise. Multum's drug information does not endorse drugs, diagnose patients or recommend therapy. The absence of a warning for a given drug or drug combination in no way should be construed to indicate that the drug or drug combination is safe, effective or appropriate for any given patient.</p>

<p>The information contained herein is not intended to cover all possible uses, directions, precautions, warnings, drug interactions, allergic reactions, or adverse effects. Conclusion The pending availability of long-acting oral hydrocodone medications will add another type of long-acting opioid medication to the chronic pain armamentarium.</p>
<p>Despite education requirements including risk evaluation and mitigation strategy and safety features such as tamper-resistance, the benefits and liabilities of long-acting hydrocodone will ultimately need to be determined by the individual physician and the individual pain patient. Prudence and adherence to best practices in opioid prescribing will be essential to allow patients to benefit from pain-relieving properties of these medications without being harmed by their potential for abuse.</p>
<p>Important stakeholders in society have already made it clear that they will be observing the impact of these new medications. For example, Senator Charles Schumer of New York wrote a letter to the FDA chairman in January, , expressing his concern about the abuse potential of long-acting hydrocodone medications and asking whether the agency was doing enough to combat the prescription drug epidemic. The pharmacogenetics of pain go far beyond metabolism, and include the role of catecholamine O-methyl transferase polymorphisms in opioid response and abuse and opioid receptor subtypes and polymorphism.</p>
<p>Some patients are predisposed to bad outcomes due to genetic and other factors. Some pain conditions tend to worsen with opioid treatment. These patients should not be started on chronic opioid therapy. There is no evidence that chronic opioid therapy is helpful for these patients.</p>
<p>For patients in whom we decide that chronic opioid therapy, as part of their multidisciplinary therapy, is a good choice because the benefits outweigh the risk, long-acting opioids are a good choice.</p>
<p>The main goal for these patients is to increase their function. There is currently no safe chronic opioid option. When considering patients for long-acting hydrocodone, the authors would advise to follow clear negative prognostic factors that have been established for chronic opioid treatment and include patients in an unstable or abusive living situation or with inadequate support, patients with poorly defined pain complaints with limited response to moderate opioid dosages, or those with somatoform disorders.</p>
