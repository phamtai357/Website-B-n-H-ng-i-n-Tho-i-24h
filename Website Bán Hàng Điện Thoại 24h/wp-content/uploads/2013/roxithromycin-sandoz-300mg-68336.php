<p>Some medicines and Roxithromycin-GA may interfere with each other. These medicines may be affected by Roxithromycin-GA, or may affect how well it works. You may need different amounts of your medicines, or you may need to take different medicines. Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking this medicine. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet. If you do not understand the instructions, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</p>
<p>How much to take The recommended dosage for adults is mg per day. You may take this according to one of the following dosage regimens: Roxithromycin may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide, resulting in increased serum concentrations of this agent.</p>
<p>Elevated serum levels of pimozide have been associated with adverse cardiovascular effects including QT interval prolongation, torsades de pointes, cardiac arrhythmia, and sudden death. The concomitant administration of roxithromycin with pimozide is contra-indicated. Concomitant administrations not recommended: Terfenadine and Astemizole Enzyme inhibiting drugs such as roxithromycin and other macrolides may lead to the decreased hepatic metabolism of terfenadine and astemizole resulting in increased serum concentrations of terfenadine and astemizole.</p>
<p>Although such a risk is not verified for roxithromycin, combination of roxithromycin with such drugs is not recommended. Warfarin Although roxithromycin has a lesser inhibiting effect on cytochrome P enzymes than other macrolide antibiotics, some reports have suggested that roxithromycin may potentiate the effects of warfarin when given concomitantly to severely ill, elderly or compromised patients.</p>
<p>Therefore the concurrent administration of roxithromycin and warfarin may result in the inhibition of warfarin metabolism, and increase the risk of bleeding.</p></p>
