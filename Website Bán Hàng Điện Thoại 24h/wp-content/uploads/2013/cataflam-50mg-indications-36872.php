            <h1>Cataflam 50mg indications</h1>
        </div>
	 
		<p><p>In migraine an initial dose of 50 mg should be taken at the first signs of an impending attack. In cases where relief 2 hours after the first dose is not sufficient, a further dose of 50 mg may be taken. If needed, further doses of 50 mg may be taken at intervals of 4 — 6 hours, not exceeding a total dose of mg per day.</p>
<p>Paediatric population For children over 14 years of age, the recommended daily dose is mg in two or three divided doses. Diclofenac Potassium 25mg Tablets are not recommended for children under 14 years of age. The use of Diclofenac Potassium 50 mg tablets in migraine attacks has not been established in children. Elderly The elderly are at increased risk of the serious consequences of adverse reactions.</p>
<p>If an NSAID is considered necessary, the lowest effective dose should be used and for the shortest possible duration. Renal impairment No adjustment of the starting dose is required for renally impaired patients see section 4.</p>
<p>Hepatic impairment No adjustment of the starting dose is required for hepatically impaired patients see section 4. If you are allergic to peanut or soya, do not use this medicinal product. The use of Diclofenac potassium with concomitant NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors should be avoided due to the absence of any evidence demonstrating synergistic benefits and the potential for additive undesirable effects see section 4.</p>
<p>Elderly Caution is indicated in the elderly on basic medical grounds. The elderly have increased frequency of adverse reactions to NSAIDs especially gastro intestinal bleeding and perforation which may be fatal.</p>
<p>In particular, it is recommended that the lowest effective dose be used in frail elderly patients or those with a low body weight see section 4. Gastrointestinal Close medical surveillance is imperative in patients with symptoms indicative of gastrointestinal disorders, with a history suggestive of gastric or intestinal ulceration, bleeding or perforation, with ulcerative colitis, or with Crohn's disease as these conditions may be exacerbated see section 4.</p>
<p>Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly when elderly, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms especially GI bleeding particularly in the initial stages of treatment. GI bleeding haematemesis, melaena , ulceration or perforation, which can be fatal, has been reported with all NSAIDs at any time during treatment, with or without warning symptoms or a previous history of serious GI events.</p>
<p>They generally have more serious consequences in the elderly. The risk of GI bleeding, ulceration or perforation is higher with increasing NSAID doses, in patients with a history of ulcer, particularly if complicated with haemorrhage or perforation see section 4. These patients should commence and maintain treatment on the lowest dose available. Combination therapy with protective agents e. Caution should be advised in patients receiving concomitant medications which increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors or anti-platelet agents such as aspirin see section 4.</p>
<p>When GI bleeding or ulceration occurs in patients receiving diclofenac potassium, the treatment should be withdrawn. SLE and mixed connective tissue disease: In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus SLE and mixed connective tissue disorders there may be an increased risk of aseptic meningitis see section 4. Cardiovascular, Renal and Hepatic Impairment: The administration of an NSAID may cause a dose dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and precipitate renal failure.</p>
<p>As fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAIDs therapy, including diclofenac, particular caution is called for in patients with impaired cardiac or renal function, history of hypertension, the elderly, patients receiving concomitant treatment with diuretics or medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function, and those patients with substantial extracellular volume depletion from any cause, e.</p>
<p>Monitoring of renal function is recommended as a precautionary measure when using diclofenac in such cases. Discontinuation therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pre-treatment state. Hepatic Close medical surveillance is required when prescribing diclofenac to patients with impairment of hepatic function as their condition may be exacerbated.</p>
<p>During prolonged treatment with Diclofenac, regular monitoring of hepatic function is indicated as a precautionary measure. Combination therapy with protective agents e. Patients with a history of GI toxicity, particularly the elderly, should report any unusual abdominal symptoms especially GI bleeding particularly in the early stages of treatment. Caution is recommended in patients receiving concomitant medications which could increase the risk of ulceration or bleeding, such as oral corticosteroids, anticoagulants such as warfarin, anti-platelet agents such as aspirin or selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors see section 4.</p>
<p>Close medical surveillance and caution should also be exercised inpatients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease , as their condition may be exacerbated see section 4. Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that the use of diclofenac, particularly at high doses mg daily and in long term treatment may be associated with a small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events for example myocardial infarction or stroke.</p>
<p>Patients with congestive heart failure NYHA-1 and patients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events e. As the cardiovascular risks of diclofenac may increase with dose and duration of exposure, the shortest duration possible and the lowest effective daily dose should be used.</p>
<p>The patient's need for symptomatic relief and response to therapy should be re-evaluated periodically. Patients should remain alert for the signs and symptoms of serious arteriothrombotic events e.</p>
<p>Patients should be instructed to see a physician immediately in case of such an event. Hepatic effects Close medical surveillance is required when prescribing Cataflam to patients with impaired hepatic function, as their condition may be exacerbated.</p>
<p>During prolonged treatment with Cataflam, regular monitoring of hepatic function is indicated as a precautionary measure. If abnormal liver function tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if other manifestations occur e.</p>
<p>Hepatitis may occur with use of diclofenac without prodromal symptoms. Caution is called for when using Cataflam in patients with hepatic porphyria, since it may trigger an attack. Renal effects As fluid retention and oedema have been reported in association with NSAID therapy, including diclofenac, particular caution is called for in patients with impaired cardiac or renal function , history of hypertension.</p>
<p>Monitoring of renal function is recommended as a precautionary measure when using diclofenac in such cases. Discontinuation of therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pre-treatment state.</p>
<p>Skin Effects Serious skin reactions, some of them fatal, including exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, have been reported very rarely in association with the use of NSAIDs, including Cataflam see section 4. Patients appear to be at highest risk of these reactions early in the course of therapy, the onset of the reaction occurring in the majority of cases within the first month of treatment.</p>
<p>In a large, open-label, controlled trial of 3, patients treated for 2 to 6 months, patients were monitored first at 8 weeks and 1, patients were monitored again at 24 weeks. Elevations in transaminases were seen more frequently in patients with osteoarthritis than in those with rheumatoid arthritis. Almost all meaningful elevations in transaminases were detected before patients became symptomatic. Abnormal tests occurred during the first 2 months of therapy with diclofenac in 42 of the 51 patients in all trials who developed marked transaminase elevations.</p>
<p>In postmarketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first 2 months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.</p>
<p>Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation. Physicians should measure transaminases periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms.</p>
<p>The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. To minimize the possibility that hepatic injury will become severe between transaminase measurements, physicians should inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity e.</p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver related event in patients treated with diclofenac potassium tablets, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Caution should be exercised in prescribing diclofenac potassium tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic e. Anaphylactoid Reactions As with other NSAIDs, anaphylactoid reactions may occur in patients without known prior exposure to diclofenac potassium tablets.</p>
<p>Diclofenac potassium tablets should not be given to patients with the aspirin triad. This symptom complex typically occurs in asthmatic patients who experience rhinitis with or without nasal polyps, or who exhibit severe, potentially fatal bronchospasm after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.</p>
<p>Emergency help should be sought in cases where an anaphylactoid reaction occurs. These serious events may occur without warning. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and use of the drug should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Pregnancy In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, diclofenac potassium tablets should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.</p>
<p>Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids. The pharmacological activity of diclofenac potassium tablets in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.</p>
<p>This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect upon erythropoiesis. Patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs, including diclofenac potassium tablets, should have their hemoglobin or hematocrit checked if they exhibit any signs or symptoms of anemia.</p>
<p>NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients. Unlike aspirin, their effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible. Patients receiving diclofenac potassium tablets who may be adversely affected by alterations in platelet function, such as those with coagulation disorders or patients receiving anticoagulants, should be carefully monitored.</p>
<p>Preexisting Asthma Patients with asthma may have aspirin-sensitive asthma. The use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm which can be fatal.</p>
<p>Since cross-reactivity, including bronchospasm, between aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been reported in such aspirin-sensitive patients, diclofenac potassium tablets should not be administered to patients with this form of aspirin sensitivity and should be used with caution in all patients with preexisting asthma.</p>
<p>Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms.</p>
<p>Diclofenac potassium tablets, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, more serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis.</p>
<p>Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs of hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians. Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity e.</p></p>

As the cardiovascular risks of diclofenac may increase with dose and duration cataflam exposure, the shortest <b>indication</b> possible and the lowest effective daily cataflam should be used, cataflam 50mg indications. The 4'-hydroxy- diclofenac metabolite, which is formed via CYP3A4, has very weak pharmacologic activity. Coadministration of indomethacin with marijuana has been shown to significantly decrease euphoria, tachycardia, and the intraocular pressure lowering activity of marijuana. Hypertension NSAIDs, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Oral indication dosage forms, immediate-release: These additive effects cataflam not occur for at least 6 weeks after the administration of carmustine due to the delayed myelosuppressive effects of carmustine. Clinical trial and epidemiological data suggest that use of 50mg, particularly at high dose <i>50mg</i> daily and in long term treatment may be 50mg with 50mg small increased risk of arterial thrombotic events for <a href="http://dienthoai24h.com.vn/wp-new/2017/04/legit-place-to-buy-xanax-online-23828.php">legit place to buy xanax online</a> myocardial infarction or stroke, <i>cataflam 50mg indications</i>. Physicians should measure transaminases periodically in indications receiving 50mg therapy with diclofenac. Therefore, it should be given at doses lower than those that would be used in patients not receiving ciclosporin.
