		<p><p>Switch to a different antidepressant. Augment the antidepressant with thyroid supplementation, lithium, buspirone, or another antidepressant. All of these are more or less controversial, and I tend to avoid them, but all are safer than Abilify.</p>
<p>See this article on augmentation. And perhaps the best and safest option, add psychotherapy.

Because of these symptoms, getting to sleep and staying asleep has been pretty challenging.</p>
<p>Thankfully the anxiety as reported by many has been minimal…though i do worry that some side effects appear to kick in weeks after stopping the medication according to various posters here and last for weeks to months.</p>
<p>Seems to be a real lack of awareness of withdrawal problems with these powerful, mind altering drugs and also a willingness to prescribe them quickly without full consideration of the impact. Reply Link Aja April 2, , 2: Stress was up for me with being a stay at home mom and my husband was working a whole bunch.</p>
<p>I decided to give meds a try again just to help me out on my day to day. I was prescribed 5mg, but only made it through two days and then I decided you try 2. I decided to trust my gut and get off the meds.</p>
<p>With it being in my system for such a short time, how long can the withdrawal be? I honestly feel like I took ten steps back in my mental health since reintroducing mood stabilizers to my regimen.</p>
<p>Reply Link Jen April 2, , 2: I have never done that before. I stopped functioning, stopped all personal cares, stopped working, stopped interacting with my family only to sit on the couch curled in a ball crying and rocking. I wanted to die. I was admitted into the psych ward and stayed there for two weeks. They started me on Paxil. Wham, all my symptoms started to disappear. Little did I know then that they exchanged one evil for another.</p>
<p>I find myself getting ready to start withdrawal from Paxil, which is listed as the hardest SSRI to come off of as far as withdrawal. That puts me at months to taper safely off Paxil. And there is still a huge chance of withdrawal symptoms. I want my life back. I have small children. I am nearly losing my husband. It has to be worth it in the end. Reply Link Tim April 21, , 9: The discomfort in my joints knees especially and general restless when trying to sleep has been very slowly dissipating.</p>
<p>I did follow up with my doc and she confirmed the challenges with withdrawal not just with Abilify but the other med, Lamictal, that I am considering discontinuing. Reply Link Analuz April 23, , 7: I had a schizophrenia-related psychotic event when I was  It was mainly the burst of untreated paranoia that I developed in my second and third year at uni. I have been taking Abilify for many years. I recently had a therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy, that has helped me a lot to cool down my paranoia triggers.</p>
<p>I have been feeling really well and healthy, so I decided to come out of Abilify very slowly as my doctor recommended, plus having therapy support. I have been without Abilify for 2 months now and I am really grateful to myself and support to have achieved this so far.</p>
<p>However, this last week or two, I have been feeling the following: So perhaps my body is just adjusting to feelings, and perhaps is good to cry.</p>
<p>I am confused about my current state of depression, since I have not experienced this before. I only have had problems with paranoia and two weeks of hearing voices in  So I really hope it is just a withdrawal symptom.</p>
<p>I am in touch with my therapist and doctor just in case, and they are aware of the situation. I was worried that the voices will suddenly pop up from one moment to the other, however my doctor explicitly said that this cannot happen from one moment to the other when you are feeling OK.</p>
<p>There is a pattern, and for me personally is paranoia, followed by being alone a lot in my room, then illness. So, I really recommend to recognize what triggers your paranoia, in this case, because this is the root of the problem. If you control those triggers, there will be no illness. However, from today onwards you have the power to change your present and future, by building new beliefs that are kind, loving and compassionate towards you. Make those new beliefs bigger than the old ones, you can do it.</p>
<p>Even though I am worried of getting ill again, the reality is that right now I am healthy. Despite having taking Abilify for so many years. Best wishes to all. Reply Link vickie April 24, , 4: The sweats I attribute to menopause. The muscle and joint pain to my fibro. So, that means so far, so good. I realize it may takes months for your brain to readjust, but I have a great network of family and friends who support me. To all out there, take your time! There are drugs not meant to go off cold turkey and Abilify is one of those.</p>
<p>I wish you luck and good health! Reply Link Lynnie April 27, ,  I recently posted about how I got off it very slowly. I hope people will take what we have said very seriously.</p>
<p>Reply Link Lynnie April 26, , 1: I am so thankful! I took Abilify 30 mgs. First of all, I tapered off very, very slowly. I stayed months at each level of mg. I am thankful I chose this very slow process. For, I have not have severe withdrawal symptoms at all!</p>
<p>So, it has been well worth the long time I took to taper off. I no longer suffer from GERD at all. And, I had gained 40 lbs. I am a new person. So, take your time withdrawing from this medication, it is a much easier experience than if you rush it.</p>
<p>MJW August 7, , 3: I think he started out at 10 mg, but ended up taking 20mg for most part. He stopped cold turkey mid January  Its been really hard and he is going through hell. This last weekend he was suicidal took a bunch of over the counter sleep aid tablets. Spent the day in ER. Smoking has doubled to 2 packs a day.</p>
<p>How much longer will this last? Reply Link Jac April 29, , 2: I just finished my fifth and final year of university, which was a huge struggle all five years. Sometimes it got better, but for the most part it was hard and I did poorly. He keeps adding more and making the doses higher because nothing works. I ran out of Abilify starting on Friday April 24th.</p>
<p>Well besides being emotional. Or I was thinking of taking 2mg instead. This is going to be one hell of a journey. If anyone wants to chat and support each other through this journey feel free to email me. Reply Link Vickie May 4, , 5: Not the sadness type, but to help me cope with fibro. Then was put on Abilify for continuous sadness?</p>
<p>Wow, she was wrong. I decided to wean myself off both. So far, so good, thank goodness. I am doing it gradually. If it takes a year, so be it! I want to get my mojo back again. I do feel somewhat better, but I know I have a long way to go. Life will look so much brighter!!! Reply Link Daniel May 4, , 8: This is my 14th and final drug that I am tapering over the course of my lifetime.</p>
<p>The other drugs were a walk in the park compared to Abilify. I am down to 2. I went down from 15mg to 7. I bought liquid Abilify to help me with the final stage of my taper, to go more slowly, but unfortunately that liquid form is being discontinued in 10 days and will no longer be available for purchase.</p>
<p>If you want to come off Abilify you will have to do it with the tablets. Fortunately they can be cut into eighths, from my experience. You need to be slow and deliberate about it, but I have taken my 5mg prescription, and cut into 2. So you can make a 5mg prescription go fairly far. Withdrawal symptoms do subside eventually, even if it takes months or even a few years.</p>
<p>I believe in the adaptability and strength of the human body and I believe even the damage caused by psychiatric drugs can be healed eventually. That being said, the slow taper method is definitely the safest and only way to go. Reply Link Debbie May 19, , 2: I decided to wean off last fall.</p>
<p>I wake up with these symptoms every day, but they subside later in the day. Somebody tell me that it will get better.</p>
<p>I hate the doctor that put me on this in conjunction with the 50 mg of Zoloft I was on, but at the time, I was having a nervous breakdown and he thought the Abilify would help. Well, it definitely did, but today I feel I have no reason to be on it. What a horrible drug to get off of. Reply Link David May 28, , 5: I took 2 mg per day for five years and have been titrating off the drug now for over three months.</p>
<p>The withdrawal symptoms have not improved vastly at all. My psychiatrist thinks there is no such thing as withdrawal effects from Abilify but my pharmacist assures me that with the slow taper things will get better over time. Reply Link Susan September 16, , 1: It is almost 4 months. I was wondering if your depression came back? I have been told it does and can been even worse!!! I cannot stand the weight gain. Also Abilify is working well for me. Reply Link Nicole May 21, , 5: My psychiatrist prescribed Abilify as an add-on to my Effexor for depression.</p>
<p>After three months, I decided I did not want this medication anymore. I did not notice any beneficial effects; C. They withdrawal symptoms began to get really bad three days after I stopped taking Abilify. If I should turn or go straight or stop. It further makes me very skeptical that my very small dose of Ability for such a short amount of time is ripping me apart.</p>
<p>Reply Link Tracey May 21, , 9: Then, they dropped me without warning. I was working on a book before I ran out of Abilify. I work as a freelance writer to pay for groceries because over a third of my social security goes to medical expenses. Then I have bills like everyone else. At least then, my writing was very good, so no one complained if it took me a little longer than other people.</p>
<p>I was on Abilify for 3 years this last time, only being off it a few months before that, then many years before that.</p>
<p>I was a person. Messy, but a real person who cooked, took care of the budget and the bills, occasionally went to social functions and wrote. Reply Link KL May 28, , 5: I was prescribed mg. The psychiatrist refused to significantly lower the dose. The side effects were so many and so severe that it made absolutely no sense to remain on it. Abilify was literally killing me. There were absolutely no benefits to it at all. Just horrific and I do mean horrific and constant side effects.</p>
<p>I am now in about week 7 of being off of it. This is not me. The entire psych field is quackery as far as I am concerned, and these drugs amount to nothing but sheer torture of the worst kind. It is beyond criminal, but who is ever held accountable for the ensuing damage? I am going to ride this out the best that I can.</p>
<p>I am against going back and asking for more so that I can taper because I never want a molecule of Abilify ever entering my body again. God is my healer. I want to get off this drug so bad. They also recommend taking a month in between reductions to adjust, so depending on how much you are taking it may even take a couple years to completely wean off without serious side-effects.</p>
<p>Reply Link RQ June 1, , 7: I started with half a 2mg tablet, and eventually reduced to half of that and I have to admit, that it did pull me out of the deep depression I was in. However, even at this low dose, my sugars and cholesterol levels both rose and I gained about 30 pounds. I experienced excessive sweating, panic and anxiety attacks, nausea, and lack of appetite. The doctor said I needed to be back on it.</p>
<p>I did that and it took over a week to get back to semi-normal and about a month before all the symptoms left. I plan to try tapering off even more and slowly wean myself off since my doctor is not understanding that the symptoms I had were from withdrawal and not from my anxiety and depression disorders.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have to wait until I have enough vacation and sick time built up so I can take a month off and work through the withdrawals. Reply Link samantha June 2, , 3: I tapered off 90 days ago and I still have withdrawal symptoms: Anxiety, confusion, memory loss, dizzy, insomnia, joint pain, lightheaded and fatigue. I feel frustrated and stuck. I have tried supplements, they just make everything worse.</p>
<p>Is there anything that can make these symptoms end faster? I have a methylation issue that adds to the problem. Reply Link D Pye June 7, , 1: I have resolved many issues that were causing me to be depressed.</p>
<p>So I feel it is time to get off this drug. I am also on 40 mg of Celexa. Several weeks ago I quit cold turkey. At two weeks off I realized I was nauseated, exhausted, was sweating profusely. I did not get depressed. I started making extra mistakes at work. I then found this site and read the horror stories about withdrawal symptom possibilities and got scared.</p>
<p>So I went back on 5 mg twenty days ago. My cognitive performance is still below normal, but I feel well. I have more energy. I was not aware that the Abilify caused low motivation to move! I am very motivated to wean off of this drug. Dom June 10, ,  Reply Link Scared June 10, , 9: I spent half a year in the hospital then was medically discharged and sent me home. It does feel good to know people understand. Reply Link Dom June 10, ,  There may not be a reason for everything but just stay positive!</p>
<p>I agree I am happy I found this thread! I am 24 years old. I'm thinking that a lower dose may be better. I am also experiencing a rash on my leg. Not sure if it's the 5-htp or something else that I'm reacting to. I am not a doctor, but if you have excessive energy at the end of the night that may indicate that you may have too much serotonin when you go to sleep. Tryptophan or 5HTP are both precursors to serotonin. That way you should be more tired at night and should not have those anxiety issues associated with too much serotonin at night.</p>
<p>VERA at June 19, 8: Susan E at June 29, 8: Just started Lamectal and also 5-htp. Tried mg to see if i tolerate the substance and the trial was positive. I take the clinical dosage of mg. I have experienced some of the best days with energy and emotional lift that I have had in over two years. The 5-htp has dramatically changed my mood, the amount of restorative sleep I get and my energy throughout the day.</p>
<p>I am aware though that I will need to journal to make sure that I cut back if I experience a high degree of anxiety or heart racing but for now I have no side effects and am truly thankful for several days of normality which i have not had in several years.</p>
<p>Paul at June 30, 4: My progress is monitored by a naturopath. As my anxiety has increased during the past two weeks, the naturopath decreased my 5-HTP dosage to mg per day. Jasmin at July 7, 7: I am trying to be hopeful that it will work, but I am skeptical because I have tried so many antidepressants with no relief. They actually make me sicker, and increase my anxiety and feeling like I want to do something irrational like hurt myself.</p>
<p>I broke mg tablet in half, so am taking about 50 at lunchtime. The first time I took it was before bed last night, and it made me unable to sleep through the night. So, I decided to try it during the day. Does anyone know how long it might take to work? Michelle at July 11, 7: I've read through the posting above and I'm still not sure if the 5HTP is going to work for me. Basically, I'm a 28 yr old female with a history of depression. I've taken prescriptive medication - Fluoxetine for a couple of years - however, I've been off medication since March a great acheivement.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've piled on lots of weight!! I've gone from a healthy 8 stone to over 10 stone and it is making me absolutely miserable. I suffer with mood swings and have done for a months especially since coming off the tablets. I've tried all sorts of things to loose weight and improve my balance. I've got a reasonable diet, I got to the gym, I have a supportive family, I've had anti-obseity drugs and I've had hypnotherapy I don't want to become hooked on anything and I don't want the pain of the come down from anti-depressant remedies.</p>
<p>So I suppose the question should I give it a good and if so, for how long? Or, is there something else I should look at? Many thanks Posted by: Michelle at July 31, 6: I hear that it helps numbness. The reason I am asking is because, first I was taking Trazadone, and I became numb. I had three MRI'S and everything seems fine. Maybe the increased seratonin is causing my numbness. Please advise, I am desperate. Thanks for your time, Cathy Resnick Posted by: Cathy at August 8, 3: So far it has worked very well.</p>
<p>I sleep like a baby and rarely feel negative, worried, and my self esteem is very high. I have never taken any anti-depressants, but needed something. I found an article on NewsTarget. Achieve optimum mental health by supplementing deficient brain chemicals instead of resorting to dangerous antidepressant drugs I am certainly a type one.</p>
<p>As of today the only side effect I have encountered is constipation. I eat a lot of fiber and I am used to going many times a day. Right now my frequency is off. Perhaps my body is just getting used to it. In addition, my vision may or may not be getting blurry. I plan on trying it a little longer and advising my doctor of my use asap.</p>
<p>Anna King at September 1,  Through research, I found this and a healthy diet really works! I do realize that many people are on anti-depressant medication without knowing the real reason they are so sad in the first place.</p>
<p>While medication can help increase levels of seretonin, there are often many adverse side effects. There often lies a deeper reason for depression that most do not examine. A pill is not always the answer. In my experience, I had to deeply examine my own life to see what was bringing me down.</p>
