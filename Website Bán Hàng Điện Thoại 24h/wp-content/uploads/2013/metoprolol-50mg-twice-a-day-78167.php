		<p><p>Monitoring of blood pressure and dosage adjustment of the antihypertensive if necessary. Lidocaine Metoprolol can reduce the clearance of lidocaine. Mefloquine Increased risk of bradycardia Antacid showed an increase in the plasma concentrations of metoprolol when the drug was coadministered with an antacid.</p>
<p>The effects of metoprolol and other antihypertensive drugs on blood pressure are usually additive. Care should be taken when combining with other antihypertensive drugs or drugs that might reduce blood pressure, such as tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates and phenothiazines.</p>
<p>However, combinations of antihypertensive drugs may often be used with benefits to improve control of hypertension. Beta blockers reduce placental perfusion, which may result in intrauterine fetal death, immature and premature deliveries but to date prospective studies have not reported an increased risk of congenital defects in humans.</p>
<p>Metoprolol crosses the placenta and is present in cord blood, but no evidence of fetal abnormalities has been reported. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of metoprolol during pregnancy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, metoprolol has been used in pregnancy-associated hypertension under close supervision, after 20 weeks gestation. However, in neonates of treated mothers, beta-blocker pharmacologic effects may persist several days after birth and may induce bradycardia, hypoglycaemia, and respiratory distress.</p>
<p>Therefore, if metoprolol is used later in pregnancy, the possible undesirable effects on the fetus and neonate in particular hypoglycaemia, hypotension, and bradycardia must be carefully monitored during the first days after birth. Lactation Cases of neonatal hypoglycaemia and bradycardia have been described with beta-blockers with low plasma protein binding.</p>
<p>Metoprolol is excreted in human milk. Even though the metoprolol concentration in milk is very low, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with metoprolol. In case of treatment during breast feeding, infants should be monitored carefully for symptoms of beta blockade. This applies to a greater extent at the beginning of treatment. Patient should be warned accordingly. The most commonly reported adverse reactions during treatment is fatigue.</p>
<p>Gangrene in patients with severe peripheral circulatory disorder , thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis may occur very rarely less than 1 case per 1, patients. He said it was worth a try. I lost 25 pounds and I no longer wake up feeling like I am suffocating.</p>
<p>I need to confirm with another overnight recording oximeter test.. As for the bad dreams, try reading up on Lucid Dreaming, I like the work by Dr. Stephen LaBerge at Stanford. I checked his book on the subject out of the library and listened to the audio CD many times. The book also covers night terror I think. Good luck, I didn't proof read, already put too much time in.</p>
<p>My typo rate is troubling, but most are easy to figure out. Now I am taking 25 mg in the morning of generic Lopressor, and another 25 in the evening, but less than a full 12 hours apart. For example I will take the 25mg at 7 am, another  I have had breakthrough tachycardia, mostly when I wake up in the morning or a few hours after.</p>
<p>Could this be caused by the change in medication? Wanted to know about my pulse rate is it too low. When it nears time to take my second dose, maybe an hour before,I feel like what I can only describe as a pressure or ache in my heart as if it's telling me it's time for my next dose. I know that sounds kind of weird and was just wondering if anyone else has had that happen.</p>
<p>The pressure feeling always goes away about a half hour after I take my night dose andrarely if ever happens with the morning dose. I know weird right? Telmisartan-H has been started since the last months. But in the last blood test results, the Creatinine levels are hovering around 1. Is a cause for concern? Are any of these medicines contributing to this? Her urea and microalbumin ratio levels are however normal. Read More They also told me to drink a lot of OJ and eat bananas to boost my potassium levels!</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the metoprolol tartrate 25 mg morning, 25 mg evening caused chest pressure -- I went to the ER for that and was admitted a few hours later since the pressure wasn't going away. Read More Hi folks! As many of you know I am on metoprolol tartrate 25 MGs b. Even though I'm on the lowest dose I do get quite a bit of side effects as far as being overtired and dragging. My cardiologist now has started me on verapamil because my BP has been running high.</p>
<p>Pulses-The timing of upper and lower extremity pulses should be compared to exclude coarctation of the aorta. All major peripheral pulses should be evaluated to exclude aortic dissection and peripheral atherosclerosis, which may be associated with renal artery involvement.</p>
<p>Nonpharmalogical Therapy All patients with high normal or elevated blood pressure, those who have a family history of cardiovascular complications of hypertension, and those who have multiple coronary risk factors should be counseled about nonpharmacologic approaches to lowering blood pressure. Approaches of proved but modest value include weight reduction, reduced alcohol consumption, and in some patients reduced salt intake.</p>
<p>Increased activity levels should be encouraged in previously sedentary patients, but strenuous exercise training programs in already active individuals may have less benefit. Stress reduction is of unclear value. It greatly helps through biofeedback and other found methods Calcium and potassium supplements have been advocated, but their ability to lower blood pressure is limited and probably not applicable to most patients. Smoking cessation will reduce overall cardiovascular risk.</p>
<p>Antihypertensive Drug Therapy An ideal antihypertensive drug would be effective as a single agent or in combination with other agents in all classes of patients; would lower blood pressure by a physiologic mechanism; would reduce morbidity and mortality rates; would have no long-term toxicity or unpleasant side effects that affect life-styles; could be taken once a day; would not require multiple-dose titration steps; and would be of moderate cost.</p>
<p>No such agent currently exists, but the growing number of available drugs has allowed the physician to tailor treatment to the needs of individual patients.</p>
<p>The Stepped Care Approach: In the s and for most of the s, the "stepped care" approach to treatment of hypertension was advocated.</p>
<p>Patients were initially started on a diuretic agent, or beta-blocker, and other drugs were added later if required. Several trials using this approach demonstrated significant reductions in stroke and, in some cases, myocardial infarction and death..</p>
<p>A number of considerations have led some experts to question stepped care as a universal treatment plan. These include the availability of other effective and well-tolerated agents with different mechanisms of action, the recognition that patients not controlled by one agent may respond to another without moving directly to two-drug therapy, and concerns over the long-term implications of metabolic changes observed with diuretics and beta-blockers especially unfavorable changes in plasma lipids and insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p>However, unlike diuretics and beta-blockers, these newer agents have not been proved to prevent the complications of hypertension. Indeed, some of them, such as calcium blockers and alpha-blockers, have not been shown to improve outcomes for any indication. Therefore, the pendulum of opinion has begun to swing back in favor of the drugs with proved benefits. Choice of Initial Medication: Diuretics and beta-blockers should be considered for first-line therapy in most patients, but the choice of medications should be individualized.</p>
<p>Additional choices include ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers, and combined alpha- and beta-blockers. These medications are all effective and generally well tolerated the alpha-blockers less so , but responses vary among demographic groups. Selection is based upon individual factors, which include age, race, life-style, cost, the experience of the physician, and the side effects of the agent.</p>
<p>Accompanying illnesses are often the major factor in selection of medications, since these may exclude some medications or favor the use of others. Diuretics- The diuretics remain the most widely used antihypertensive medications and are the only agents shown to reduce mortality and morbidity related to coronary artery disease in major trials. Diuretics lower blood pressure initially by decreasing plasma volume by suppressing tubular reabsorption of sodium, thus increasing the excretion of sodium and water and cardiac output, but during chronic therapy their major hemodynamic effect is reduction of peripheral vascular resistance by an as yet unknown mechanism.</p>
<p>Most of the antihypertensive effect of these agents is achieved at lower dosages than used previously typically, 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide or equivalent , but their biochemical effects are dose-related. The thiazide diuretics are the most widely used. The loop diuretics such as furosemide may lead to electrolyte and volume depletion more readily than the thiazides and have short durations of action; therefore, they are not ordinarily used in hypertension except in the presence of renal dysfunction serum creatinine above 2.</p>
<p>Relative to the beta-blockers and the ACE inhibitors, diuretics are more potent in blacks, older individuals, the obese, and other sub-groups with increased plasma volume or low plasma renin activity.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they are relatively more effective in smokers than in nonsmokers. They are perhaps the most effective agents for lowering predominantly systolic hypertension. The adverse effects of diuretics are relate chiefly to the metabolic changes. Impotence, skin rashes, and photosensitivity are also less frequent side effects.</p>
<p>Hypokalemia, with the resulting potential for arrhythmias or renal dysfunction, has been a concern but is uncommon at the usual current dosages  Higher serum levels may be prudent in patients at special risk from intracellular potassium depletion patients taking digoxin or having ventricular arrhythmias and diabetics in whom insulin release and insulin sensitivity are reduced by hypokalemia. It is noteworthy that several of the trials in which diuretic therapy proved most beneficial employed combinations of thiazide and potassium-sparing agents, such as triamterene or amiloride.</p>
<p>These medications are more expensive, have additional side effects primarily gastrointestinal , and may be dangerous in the presence of oliguria. However, it is reasonable to use these agents in appropriate patients receiving higher doses of diuretics and in place of potassium supplements. Diuretics also increase serum uric acid and may precipitate acute gout. Increases in blood glucose, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and plasma insulin may occur but are relatively minor during long-term low-dose therapy.</p>
<p>Some experts feel that these lipid changes may limit the beneficial effect of blood pressure reduction on the progression of atherosclerosis. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents- These drugs are effective in hypertension because they decrease the heart rate and cardiac output. Even after continued use of beta-blockers for a number of years, cardiac output remains decreased and systemic vascular resistance increased with agents that do not have intrinsic sympathomimetic or alpha-blocking activity.</p>
<p>The beta-blockers also decrease renin release and are in general more efficacious in populations likely to have elevated plasma renin activity, such as younger white patients. They neutralize the reflex tachycardia caused by vasodilators such as hydralazine and alpha-adrenergic blockers in the treatment of hypertension. The beta-blockers are especially useful in patients with associated conditions that benefit from this mode of therapy. These include patients with angina pectoris, patients with previous myocardial infarction, and individuals with migraine headaches and somatic manifestations of anxiety.</p>
<p>The side effects of all beta-blockers include development of bronchial asthma in predisposed patients; bradycardia; atrioventricular conduction defects; left ventricular failure; nasal congestion; Raynaud's phenomenon, especially in women; and central nervous system symptoms with nightmares, excitement, and confusion.</p>
<p>Fatigue, lethargy, and impotence may occur. All beta-blockers tend to increase plasma triglycerides. The nonselective and, to a lesser extent, the cardioselective beta-blockers tend to depress the protective HDL fraction of plasma cholesterol. This is not seen in agents with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and as with diuretics, the changes are blunted with time and dietary changes.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that these lipid changes may have an adverse effect on coronary artery disease. These agents are contraindicated in patients with congestive heart failure or symptomatic bronchospasm. Beta-blockers are relatively contraindicated in insulin-dependent diabetes, since they inhibit gluconeogenesis and may prolong hypoglycemic episodes.</p>
<p>However, recent studies have not confirmed earlier suggestions that they may worsen symptoms of peripheral vascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II blockers- These drugs are being increasingly used as the initial medication in mild to moderate hypertension. Their primary mode of action is inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but they also inhibit bradykinin degradation, stimulate vasodilating prostaglandin synthesis, and, sometimes, reduce sympathetic nervous system activity.</p>
<p>These latter actions may explain why they exhibit some effect even in patients with low plasma renin activity. The ACE inhibitors appear to be most effective in younger whites.</p>
<p>They are relatively less effective in blacks and in the elderly and in predominantly systolic hypertension. An advantage of the ACE inhibitors is their relative freedom from troublesome side effects. Severe hypotension can occur in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis; acute renal failure may ensue. Hyperkalemia may develop in patients with intrinsic renal disease and type IV renal tubular acidosis commonly seen in diabetics and in the elderly.</p>
<p>Skin rashes and taste alterations are seen more often with captopril than with the non-sulfhydryl-containing agents enalapril and lisinopril but often disappear with continued therapy. Angioneurotic edema is an uncommon but potentially dangerous side effect of all agents of this class. Proteinuria and neutropenia are very uncommon at the lower dosages now employed except in individuals with preexisting renal insufficiency or autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>Calcium channel blockers- All the agents of this class reduce blood pressure, and a number of new agents with a longer duration of action and perhaps less negative inotropic activity are available. They act by causing peripheral vasodilation, which is associated with less reflex tachycardia and fluid retention than other vasodilators.</p></p>
