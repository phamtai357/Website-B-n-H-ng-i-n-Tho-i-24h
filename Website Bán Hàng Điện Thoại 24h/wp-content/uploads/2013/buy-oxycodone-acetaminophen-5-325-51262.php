		<p><p>If you do not have a dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not crush, break, or open an extended-release pill. Swallow it whole to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal dose. If you need surgery, tell the surgeon ahead of time that you are using this medicine.</p>
<p>You may need to stop using the medicine for a short time. Do not stop using this medicine suddenly after long-term use, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Ask your doctor how to safely stop using the medicine. Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Keep track of the amount of medicine used from each new bottle. Oxycodone is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.</p>
<p>Do not keep leftover acetaminophen and oxycodone pills or liquid. Ask your pharmacist where to locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, flush any unused pills or liquid medicine down the toilet.</p>
<p>Never crush or break an acetaminophen and oxycodone pill to inhale the powder or mix it into a liquid to inject the drug into your vein. What happens if I miss a dose? Since this medicine is used for pain, you are not likely to miss a dose. Instead, they must consult with their prescribing physician. Patients should not combine oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets with alcohol, opioid analgesics, tranquilizers, sedatives, or other CNS depressants unless under the recommendation and guidance of a physician.</p>
<p>When co-administered with another CNS depressant, oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets can cause dangerous additive central nervous system or respiratory depression, which can result in serious injury or death. The safe use of oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets during pregnancy has not been established; thus, women who are planning to become pregnant or are pregnant should consult with their physician before taking oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets.</p>
<p>Nursing mothers should consult with their physicians about whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets because of the potential for serious adverse reactions to nursing infants. Patients who are treated with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets for more than a few weeks should be advised not to abruptly discontinue the medication. Patients should consult with their physician for a gradual discontinuation dose schedule to taper off the medication.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised that oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets are a potential drug of abuse. They should protect it from theft, and it should never be given to anyone other than the individual for whom it was prescribed. Although oxycodone may cross-react with some drug urine tests, no available studies were found which determined the duration of detectability of oxycodone in urine drug screens.</p>
<p>However, based on pharmacokinetic data, the approximate duration of detectability for a single dose of oxycodone is roughly estimated to be one to two days following drug exposure. Urine testing for opiates may be performed to determine illicit drug use and for medical reasons such as evaluation of patients with altered states of consciousness or monitoring efficacy of drug rehabilitation efforts. The preliminary identification of opiates in urine involves the use of an immunoassay screening and thin-layer chromatography TLC.</p>
<p>The identities of 6-keto opiates e. Opioid analgesics may enhance the neuromuscular-blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increase in the degree of respiratory depression. Patients receiving CNS depressants such as other opioid analgesics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, centrally-acting anti-emetics, sedative-hypnotics or other CNS depressants including alcohol concomitantly with oxycodone and acetaminophen tablets may exhibit an additive CNS depression.</p>
<p>The concurrent use of anticholinergics with opioids may produce paralytic ileus. Hepatotoxicity has occurred in chronic alcoholics following various dose levels moderate to excessive of acetaminophen. The onset of acetaminophen effect may be delayed or decreased slightly, but the ultimate pharmacological effect is not significantly affected by anticholinergics.</p>
<p>Increase in glucuronidation resulting in increased plasma clearance and a decreased half-life of acetaminophen.</p>
<p>Reduces acetaminophen absorption when administered as soon as possible after overdose. Propranolol appears to inhibit the enzyme systems responsible for the glucuronidation and oxidation of acetaminophen.</p>
<p>Therefore, the pharmacologic effects of acetaminophen may be increased. The effects of the loop diuretic may be decreased because acetaminophen may decrease renal prostaglandin excretion and decrease plasma renin activity.</p>
<p>Serum lamotrigine concentrations may be reduced, producing a decrease in therapeutic effects. Probenecid may increase the therapeutic effectiveness of acetaminophen slightly. All the information I could ever find on hydrocodone seemed to indicate that it was a pure opoid agonist, and that the only ceiling effect for it was strictly due to the APAP that's always included. Twenty-three doctors were arrested for writing prescriptions in exchange for other purposes as well.</p>
<p>Like milligrams per day? That seemed long compared to a 2 week withdrawal from heroin. Anyone know about the Medtronic? Hi, if you don't have apache to access http: There is no consensus on the best method of managing withdrawal. Labor And Delivery As with all narcotics, administration of this product to the mother shortly before delivery may result in some degree of respiratory depression in the newborn, especially if higher doses are used.</p>
<p>Nursing Mothers Acetaminophen is excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of its effects on nursing infants is not known.</p>
<p>It is not known whether hydrocodone is excreted in human milk. PERCOCET should not be given to a pregnant woman unless in the judgment of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nonteratogenic Effects Opioids can cross the placental barrier and have the potential to cause neonatal respiratory depression. Opioid use during pregnancy may result in a physically drug-dependent fetus.</p>
<p>After birth, the neonate may suffer severe withdrawal symptoms. Labor and Delivery PERCOCET tablets are not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery due to its potential effects on respiratory function in the newborn. Acetaminophen is also excreted in breast milk in low concentrations. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.</p>
<p>Geriatric Use Special precaution should be given when determining the dosing amount and frequency of PERCOCET tablets for geriatric patients, since clearance of oxycodone may be slightly reduced in this patient population when compared to younger patients. Hepatic Impairment In a pharmacokinetic study of oxycodone in patients with end-stage liver disease, oxycodone plasma clearance decreased and the elimination half-life increased. Care should be exercised when oxycodone is used in patients with hepatic impairment.</p>
<p>Renal Impairment In a study of patients with end stage renal impairment, mean elimination half-life was prolonged in uremic patients due to increased volume of distribution and reduced clearance. Oxycodone should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment.</p></p>
