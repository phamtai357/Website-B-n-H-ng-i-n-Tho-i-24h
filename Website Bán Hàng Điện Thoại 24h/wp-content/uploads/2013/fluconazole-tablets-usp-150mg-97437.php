		<p><p>If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist. In the US - Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. In Canada - Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to Health Canada at  Before taking fluconazole, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to it; or to other azole antifungal drugs such as ketoconazole, itraconazole ; or if you have any other allergies.</p>
<p>This product may contain inactive ingredients, which can cause allergic reactions or other problems. Talk to your pharmacist for more details.</p>
<p>Before using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: Fluconazole may cause a condition that affects the heart rhythm QT prolongation. The risk of QT prolongation may be increased if you have certain medical conditions or are taking other drugs that may cause QT prolongation. Before using fluconazole, tell your doctor or pharmacist of all the drugs you take and if you have any of the following conditions: Before using Some medicines or medical conditions may interact with Fluconazole.</p>
<p>Inform your doctor of any other medical conditions including a history of any heart problems, irregular heartbeat such as QT prolongation , electrolyte problems, kidney or liver problems, cancer, HIV infection, diabetes, allergies, pregnancy, or breast-feeding.</p>
<p>Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions or concerns about taking this medicine. Directions Follow the directions for using this medicine provided by your doctor.</p>
<p>This medicine may come with a patient information leaflet. Half of the celecoxib dose may be necessary when combined with Fluconazole. Combination therapy with cyclophosphamide and Fluconazole results in an increase in serum bilirubin and serum creatinine. The combination may be used while taking increased consideration to the risk of increased serum bilirubin and serum creatinine. One fatal case of possible fentanyl Fluconazole interaction was reported.</p>
<p>The author judged that the patient died from fentanyl intoxication. Furthermore, in a randomized crossover study with 12 healthy volunteers it was shown that Fluconazole delayed the elimination of fentanyl significantly. Elevated fentanyl concentration may lead to respiratory depression. Fluconazole can increase halofantrine plasma concentration due to an inhibitory effect on CYP3A4.</p>
<p>If concomitant therapy is necessary, the patient should be observed for symptoms of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis and creatinine kinase should be monitored. Fluconazole inhibits the metabolism of losartan to its active metabolite E 74 which is responsible for most of the angiotensin Il-receptor antagonism which occurs during treatment with losartan.</p>
<p>Patients should have their blood pressure monitored continuously. Fluconazole may enhance the serum concentration of methadone.</p>
<p>Dosage adjustment of methadone may be necessary. There was a case report that a liver-transplanted patient treated with prednisone developed acute adrenal cortex insufficiency when a three month therapy with Fluconazole was discontinued. The discontinuation of Fluconazole presumably caused an enhanced CYP3A4 activity which led to increased metabolism of prednisone. Patients on long-term treatment with Fluconazole and prednisone should be carefully monitored for adrenal cortex insufficiency when Fluconazole is discontinued.</p>
<p>Dosage adjustment of saquinavir may be necessary. Fluconazole increases plasma concentrations of sirolimus presumably by inhibiting the metabolism of sirolimus via CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. Although not studied, Fluconazole may increase the plasma levels of the vinca alkaloids e. Based on a case report in one patient receiving combination therapy with all-transretinoid acid an acid form of vitamin A and Fluconazole, CNS related undesirable effects have developed in the form of pseudotumour cerebri, which disappeared after discontinuation of Fluconazole treatment.</p>
<p>This combination may be used but the incidence of CNS related undesirable effects should be borne in mind. Patients receiving this combination should be monitored for the development of zidovudine-related adverse reactions. Dosage reduction of zidovudine may be considered. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Fluconazole showed no evidence of carcinogenic potential in mice and rats treated orally for 24 months at doses of 2.</p>
<p>What should I know regarding pregnancy, nursing and administering Fluconazole Tablet Azole Antifungals-Systemic to children or the elderly? Interactions Drug interactions may change how your medications work or increase your risk for serious side effects. This document does not contain all possible drug interactions. Do not start, stop, or change the dosage of any medicines without your doctor's approval.</p>
<p>Products that may interact with this drug include: Many drugs besides fluconazole may affect the heart rhythm QT prolongation , including pimozide , quinidine , macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin , among others. Fluconazole can slow down the removal of other medications from your body, which can affect how they work.</p>
<p>Examples of affected drugs include asunaprevir, cisapride, among others. Overdose If someone has overdosed and has serious symptoms such as passing out or trouble breathing , call  An example of the affected drugs is cisapride , among others. If overdose is suspected, contact a poison control center or emergency room immediately. US residents can call their local poison control center at  Canada residents can call a provincial poison control center.</p>
<p>Symptoms of overdose may include: Store at room temperature away from light and moisture. Quinidine Although not studied in vitro or in vivo, concomitant administration of fluconazole with quinidine may result in inhibition of quinidine metabolism. Use of quinidine has been associated with QT prolongation and rare occurrences of torsades de pointes. Coadministration of fluconazole and quinidine is contraindicated. Oral Hypoglycemics The effects of fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of the sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents tolbutamide, glipizide, and glyburide were evaluated in three placebo-controlled studies in normal volunteers.</p>
<p>All subjects received the sulfonylurea alone as a single dose and again as a single dose following the administration of DIFLUCAN mg daily for 7 days. Tolbutamide In 13 normal male volunteers, there was significant increase in tolbutamide mg single dose AUC and Cmax following the administration of fluconazole. Glyburide The AUC and Cmax of glyburide 5 mg single dose were significantly increased following the administration of fluconazole in 20 normal male volunteers.</p>
<p>Five subjects required oral glucose following the ingestion of glyburide after 7 days of fluconazole administration. Rifabutin There have been published reports that an interaction exists when fluconazole is administered concomitantly with rifabutin, leading to increased serum levels of rifabutin.</p>
<p>Tacrolimus There have been published reports that an interaction exists when fluconazole is administered concomitantly with tacrolimus, leading to increased serum levels of tacrolimus. Cisapride A placebo-controlled, randomized, multiple-dose study examined the potential interaction of fluconazole with cisapride. Two groups of 10 normal subjects were administered fluconazole mg daily or placebo. Cisapride 20 mg four times daily was started after 7 days of fluconazole or placebo dosing.</p>
<p>Fluconazole significantly increased the QTc interval in subjects receiving cisapride 20 mg four times daily for 5 days.</p></p>

Adrenal insufficiency relating to concomitant treatment with Prednisone is described in section 4. It may be useful to monitor renal function. Resulting increased plasma concentrations of astemizole can lead to QT prolongation and rare occurrences of torsade depointes. Another study at a mg and mg daily <i>usp</i> of fluconazole demonstrated that Fluconazole taken in doses of mg per day or greater significantly increases usp levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly. These elevations occurred in patients with severe underlying disease, predominantly AIDS or malignancies, most of whom were receiving multiple concomitant medications, including many known to be hepatotoxic. Avoid concomitant administration of voriconazole and Fluconazole.
