		<p><p>This common question can be confusing to even veteran thyroid patients. Let's clear up the main difference: Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a disease; hypothyroidism is a condition. In the United States, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but the two terms are not interchangeable. Here is more information to help understand the difference. Overview Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease that affects your thyroid gland.</p>
<p>It is sometimes known as Hashimoto's disease, autoimmune thyroiditis, or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis. In Hashimoto's, antibodies react against proteins in your thyroid gland, causing gradual destruction of the gland itself, and making it unable to produce the thyroid hormones your body needs.</p>
<p>Diagnosis Hashimoto's disease is typically diagnosed by clinical examination that demonstrates one or more of the following findings: Enlargement of your thyroid, known as a goiter High levels of antibodies against thyroglobulin TG and thyroid peroxidase TPO , detected via blood test Fine needle aspiration of your thyroid also known as a needle biopsy , which shows lymphocytes and macrophages A radioactive uptake scan, which would show diffuse uptake in your enlarged thyroid gland Ultrasound, which would show an enlarged thyroid gland Symptoms If you have Hashimoto's thyroiditis, you may have no demonstrable symptoms.</p>
<p>This can leave patients miserable for years, even though all of the symptoms are present and autoimmune susceptibility is already established. It is recommended that anyone with a pre-existing autoimmune disease such as type 1 diabetes request a full thyroid panel, including thyroid antibodies during your routine blood testing. How Do Autoimmune Diseases Start? There is a genetic component to these common autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>Specific genes that are responsible for certain autoimmune diseases are being identified but the environmental triggers that activate these genes are yet unknown.</p>
<p>Autoimmune disease can run in families in one of two ways: Autoimmune Clustering Scientists have also put these autoimmune diseases into tidy little categories based on whether a person is more likely to develop a second autoimmune disorder when they already have one from the same category.</p>
<p>Much like the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, you can suffer through symptoms of autoimmune disorders while your blood levels are still considered in the normal range subclinical. Many people suffer needlessly. Awareness of the susceptibility of other autoimmune disorders can help in getting the treatment that you need. Official Journal of the American Thyroid Association, 19 2 , 99— The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, 90 8 , — What do you suggest as a solution to the needless suffering?</p>
<p>You also will swing between hypo and hyper as explained above. You want to stop the attack and the swings, and the only way to do that is to be on thyroid meds, and raise high enough to stop the attack, which in turn will stop the hyper swings. Naltrexone is a an opioid antagonist, and when taken in low doses, has been found to elevate your endorphins, which in turn promotes better immune function.</p>
<p>It has to be shaken before use. Using a baby medicine dropper, or even more accurate, a syringe, many patients start at 1. Patients report vivid dreaming the first several nights, but it goes away. They slowly make their way up to 3 mg. The maximum is 4. Once antibodies fall, you may suddenly find yourself on too much medication for your needs.</p>
<p>Doing an iodine loading test can confirm if you have low iodine. And since iodine is the main component of thyroid hormones, plus has anti-cancer benefit, the use of iodine can be a wise decision. Bottom line, we let each person decide what is right for them. Celiac disease is a autoimmune digestive disorder that results in an overreaction to gluten, a protein found in most grains like wheat, rye, oats and barley, which can be found in breads, cereals, pasta and many processed foods.</p>
<p>The overreaction, in turn, causes autoimmune damage to the intestines, which results in poor absorption of nutrients. Oats, which can be gluten-free, are often contaminated within soil where gluten grains were once grown, or in the processing facility.</p>
<p>Or, there are tests developed to help you figure out if you have Celiac disease, and the stool test is highly recommended. You can both both hyper and hypo symptoms. Low Dose Naltrexone has been helpful for many individuals who have these antibodies. See the Things We Have Learned page. And during that treatment, you raise according to the elimination of symptoms, not labs.</p></p>
