		<p><p>Drug therapies for anxiety disorders work best in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy or some other forms of psychotherapy. SSRIs can cause agitation, nausea, and diarrhea. Sexual function side effects include low sex drive, inability to have an orgasm, and impotence. Over time, many SSRI-treated patients gain weight, although the degree of weight gain varies depending on the drug.</p>
<p>Elderly people taking these drugs should take the lowest effective dose possible, and those with heart problems should be monitored closely. There have been many concerns about SSRIs and increased risk for suicidal behavior.</p>
<p>Concern is greatest for children, but both adults and children who are treated with SSRIs should be carefully monitored for any worsening of depressive symptoms or changes in behavior. This is especially important during the first few months of antidepressant treatment. Paroxetine has been linked to heart-related birth defects when women took this drug during the first trimester of pregnancy. It should not be taken by women who are pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant.</p>
<p>Other SSRIs are generally considered safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Still, women who are pregnant or who are considering becoming pregnant should discuss the potential risks of these drugs with their doctors.</p>
<p>Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors SNRIs. Drugs in this class include Klonopin clonazepam , Ativan lorazepam , and Xanax alprazolam. While benzodiazepines act quickly, approximately one-half of patients experience withdrawal symptoms when removed from the medication and many clinicians believe that patients receiving them may develop a tolerance to the drug.</p>
<p>Once the prescribed antidepressant takes effect, the dose of benzodiazepine is slowly decreased until it can be stopped safely. Benzodiazepines cause sedation and may also increase falls, and cause confusion and memory problems in the elderly.</p>

<p>A drug like Effexor hand might be used in people with generalized anxiety disorder as well as depression. Taking SNRIs can also trigger an imbalance of serotonin levels in the brain referred to as serotonin syndrome. Benzodiazepines are an older class of drugs still used for short-term management of anxiety. They can be highly effective in promoting relaxation, reducing muscle tension and other physical symptoms associated with anxiety by enhancing the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA.</p>
<p>As such, concerns about long-term use of benzodiazepines led many psychiatrists and physicians to favor tricyclic antidepressants before SSRIs and SNRIs came on the market. Tricyclics are relatively effective for treating anxiety because they increase serotonin levels in the brain, but they are also problematic long term.</p>
<p>Consequently, tricyclic antidepressants aren't usually prescribed unless you've been on a SSRI and it hasn't worked for you. Nefazodone In a study of steady-state pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers, coadministration of buspirone 2. With 5 mg b. Subjects receiving buspirone 5 mg b.</p>
<p>If the two drugs are to be used in combination, the dosage of buspirone may need adjusting to maintain anxiolytic effect. Other Inhibitors And Inducers Of CYP3A4 Substances that inhibit CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole or ritonavir, may inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone while substances that induce CYP3A4, such as dexamethasone, or certain anticonvulsants phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine , may increase the rate of buspirone metabolism.</p>
<p>If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose adjustment of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Examples are mirtazapine Remeron , venlafaxine Effexor and duloxetine Cymbalta.</p>
<p>Older antidepressants are also effective. They include tricyclic antidepressants for example, nortriptyline , imipramine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors MAOIs, for example, phenelzine. Since antidepressants often take several weeks to work, your doctor may also prescribe a fast-acting benzodiazepine for relief.</p>
<p>Benzodiazepines — These drugs affect a chemical messenger that works in the brain's fear response system. Examples of benzodiazepines are clonazepam Klonopin , lorazepam Ativan , diazepam Valium and alprazolam Xanax.</p>
<p>They are reasonably safe and often bring quick relief from symptoms of anxiety. Since they act immediately, they may be prescribed during the first weeks of treatment while waiting for an antidepressant medication to take hold. Another reason these drugs are prescribed for a relatively short time is that the body sometimes becomes accustomed to the effect. That is, benzodiazepines may provide less relief as time goes on.</p>
<p>If you need to stop taking these drugs, do so gradually under a doctor's direction, because withdrawal reactions can occur. Buspirone BuSpar — Buspirone is an antianxiety drug that can be effective for generalized anxiety disorder. However, it is used much less frequently than the drugs listed above. Like antidepressants, it usually takes two to three weeks to begin working.</p></p>
