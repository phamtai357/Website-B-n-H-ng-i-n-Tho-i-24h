		<p><p>All of my life I have been prone to entering berserk rages at the drop of a hat. It has been a lifelong struggle of mine to come to terms with this, to learn why and how, and to learn to control it. It is the same for every other self-identified berserker I have met, as well as for those identifying in other ways, such as Leopard Men and those who run amok. When we discovered the existence of Intermittent Explosive Disorder we were shocked. We knew of the manners in which the ancients looked at people like us, and we knew that we were prone to being viewed as crazy in various ways by the modern medical establishment.</p>
<p>But we had never before heard of IED, and when we did, we identified with each and every sign and symptom of it. So thoroughly that most of us are convinced that we have IED. To explain why this is so, here is a list of the features we had found common to our natures as berserks and such: Outside the gangr, especially immediately after it, we tend to suffer from depression, chills, confusion, carbohydrate cravings, insomnia, and other things associated with low serotonin levels.</p>
<p>Perhaps part of the reason they are low is that we use up too much during the gangr. There are far too many matches here for this to be coincidence. It seems to most, if not all of us, that the berserker nature is identical to IED. Does this not mean that there are better ways of dealing with this nature than medication into a near comatose or at least unbalanced and injured state?</p>
<p>This approach can lead to depression and feelings of unworthiness, and can even cause serious psychological complexes. Such unfortunates often come to have very low feelings of self worth.</p>
<p>And more, many of us berserker types spend most of our lives feeling like we are at war with ourselves, that we have a divided nature. We often never know a feeling of rest or peace. This sort of therapy only exacerbates this condition. All in all I, and most other berserker types, do not feel that the modern medical community is very well equipped to handle this condition.</p>
<p>We feel that we are not sick. We are not unwell. We are simply different. And those differences in nature mean we need differences in treatment. If you have been diagnosed with IED, or suspect you suffer from it, consider that the modern medical community might not really be the best source of information on how to deal with the problems it raises.</p>
<p>There are other ways. We modern berserks and such have taken lessons from the ancients, learned to take advantage of what this nature can do for us.</p>
<p>Learned what makes us tick. Learned to take this knowledge and find a balance, a way of living that does not suppress our true inherent natures but also does not let us run away into expressions of inappropriate violence. We approach things from a spiritual perspective, as the ancients did.</p>
<p>This is a miracle. Granted it will not "cure" everything, but again, it allows him to be able to participate in therapy. Being around him now, most of the time you would think he is just a typical child, not one who has had a life of hell, been over-medicated even so badly that he had to be admitted to the hospital to detox him, almost dying from the toxicity of the other medications the doc had him on.</p>
<p>Ironically, even after I was so upfront with Jeff's treatment, or even plans of starting him on the medical marijuana, social services gave me thumbs up with going forward on medical exploration. Jeff qualified as severely ill, nothing else had worked and I was about to lose him to an institution. Finally on December 4, it was ruled that I could continue giving my son his medical marijuana.</p>
<p>It was a landmark court ruling because it has never been used before in children. Medical marijuana was and is the only thing to have ever, ever been used on my son that gave him the chance at a normal life.</p>
<p>I beg everyone to write congress to get this passed federally. How many more children and adults too suffer with mental illness and have come to the end of the road We now give Jeff the medicine in the form of capsules.</p>
<p>It is a tedious process, but again, I would go to the ends of the earth for my son. My mother helps me make it every week for him. We grind up the marijuana in a coffee grinder, sift it, put it on the skillet for an hour with butter and water to cook it, then we spread it out in a big lasagna type pan and bake it in the oven to dry it back out to a powder so that we can put it into capsules.</p>
<p>It takes over 5 hours to do the entire process. Come up with a code word or visual signal that means you need the police and share it with friends, family and your children. Treatment is attempted through both cognitive behavioral therapy and psychotropic medication regimens, though the pharmaceutical options have shown limited success.</p>
<p>Therapy aids in helping the patient recognize the impulses in hopes of achieving a level of awareness and control of the outbursts, along with treating the emotional stress that accompanies these episodes.</p>
<p>Multiple drug regimens are frequently indicated for IED patients. This therapy consists of 12 sessions, the first three focusing on relaxation training, then cognitive restructuring, then exposure therapy. The final sessions focus on resisting aggressive impulses and other preventative measures. Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs such as fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline appear to alleviate some pathopsychological symptoms.</p>
<p>GABAergic mood stabilizers and anticonvulsive drugs such as gabapentin, lithium, carbamazepine, and divalproex seem to aid in controlling the incidence of outbursts. Anxiolytics help alleviate tension and may help reduce explosive outbursts by increasing the provocative stimulus tolerance threshold, and are especially indicated in patients with comorbid obsessive-compulsive or other anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>Impulsive behavior, and especially impulsive violence predisposition has been correlated to a low brain serotonin turnover rate, indicated by a low concentration of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid 5-HIAA in the cerebrospinal fluid CSF. This substrate appears to act on the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus, which is the target for serotonergic output from the dorsal and median raphe nuclei playing a role in maintaining the circadian rhythm and regulation of blood sugar.</p>
<p>A tendency towards low 5-HIAA may be hereditary. Other traits that correlate with IED are low vagal tone and increased insulin secretion. A suggested explanation for IED is a polymorphism of the gene for tryptophan hydroxylase, which produces a serotonin precursor; this genotype is found more commonly in individuals with impulsive behavior. IED may also be associated with lesions in the prefrontal cortex, with damage to these areas, including the amygdala, increasing the incidence of impulsive and aggressive behavior and the inability to predict the outcomes of an individual's own actions.</p>
<p>Lesions in these areas are also associated with improper blood sugar control, leading to decreased brain function in these areas, which are associated with planning and decision making.</p></p>
