		<p><p>The duration of diuretic effect is 6 to 8 hours. Although furosemide is more rapidly absorbed from the oral solution 50 minutes than from the tablet 87 minutes , peak plasma levels and area under the plasma concentration-time curves do not differ significantly. Peak plasma concentrations increase with increasing dose but times-to-peak do not differ among doses. The terminal half-life of furosemide is approximately 2 hours. Significantly more furosemide is excreted in urine following the IV injection than after the tablet or oral solution.</p>
<p>There are no significant differences between the two oral formulations in the amount of unchanged drug excreted in urine. Geriatric Population Furosemide binding to albumin may be reduced in elderly patients. Furosemide is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine. The renal clearance of furosemide after intravenous administration in older healthy male subjects 60—70 years of age is statistically significantly smaller than in younger healthy male subjects 20—35 years of age.</p>
<p>The initial diuretic effect of furosemide in older subjects is decreased relative to younger subjects. LASIX is particularly useful when an agent with greater diuretic potential is desired. Hypertension Oral LASIX may be used in adults for the treatment of hypertension alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. Hypertensive patients who cannot be adequately controlled with thiazides will probably also not be adequately controlled with LASIX alone.</p>
<p>In hepatic coma and in states of electrolyte depletion, therapy should not be instituted until the basic condition is improved. Sudden alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance in patients with cirrhosis may precipitate hepatic coma; therefore, strict observation is necessary during the period of diuresis.</p>
<p>Supplemental potassium chloride and, if required, an aldosterone antagonist are helpful in preventing hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.</p>
<p>If increasing azotemia and oliguria occur during treatment of severe progressive renal disease, LASIX should be discontinued. Care must be taken to ensure that the pH of the prepared infusion solution is in the weakly alkaline to neutral range.</p>
<p>Acid solutions, including other parenteral medications e. In addition, furosemide injection should not be added to a running intravenous line containing any of these acidic products. Acute Pulmonary Edema The usual initial dose of furosemide is 40 mg injected slowly intravenously over 1 to 2 minutes. If a satisfactory response does not occur within 1 hour, the dose may be increased to 80 mg injected slowly intravenously over 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
<p>The unbound fraction averages 2. The onset of diuresis following oral administration is within 1 hour. The peak effect occurs within the first or second hour. The duration of diuretic effect is 6 to 8 hours. Although furosemide is more rapidly absorbed from the oral solution 50 minutes than from the tablet 87 minutes , peak plasma levels and area under the plasma concentration-time curves do not differ significantly.

Supplemental potassium chloride and, if required, an aldosterone antagonist are helpful in preventing hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.</p>
<p>Renal oedema in nephrotic syndrome. Oedema occurring during the last three months of pregnancy-pre-eclamptic toxaemia and eclampsia. As an adjunct in acute pulmonary oedema. Hypertension of mild to moderate degree.</p>
<p>Barbiturate poisoning using the principle of "forced diuresis". Patients who are hypersensitive to furosemide or sulphonamides. Furosemide should not be given to lactating women. Furosemide should be administered during pregnancy only if strictly indicated, and then only for short periods of time.</p>
<p>This dose may, however, be increased depending on the response of the patient. In combination with other hypotensive drugs, lower doses will often suffice. The rapid and powerful effect produced by intravenous injection may result in a transitory fall in plasma volume. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia can occur and gout may rarely be precipitated. The possibility exists of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus. As with many other drugs, patients should be observed regularly for the possible occurrence of blood dyscrasias, liver or kidney damage, or other idiosyncratic reactions.</p>
<p>Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting profusely or receiving parenteral fluids. Abnormalities should be corrected or the drug temporarily withdrawn. Other medications may also influence serum electrolytes. Reversible elevations of BUN may occur and are associated with dehydration, which should be avoided, particularly in patients with renal insufficiency. Urine and blood glucose should be checked periodically in diabetics receiving LASIX, even in those suspected of latent diabetes.</p>
<p>LASIX may lower serum levels of calcium rarely cases of tetany have been reported and magnesium.</p></p>
