		<p><p>Learning may or may not be impaired. Drug treatment may not be indicated for all children with this syndrome. Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is often helpful.</p>
<p>Patients with a history of drug abuse. During or within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors hypertensive crises may result.</p>
<p>Adults Sudden deaths, stroke, and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD. Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is also unknown, adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems.</p>
<p>While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short-term consequences, all patients should be monitored for larger changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Caution is indicated in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate, e. Assessing Cardiovascular Status in Patients being Treated with Stimulant Medications Children, adolescents, or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should have a careful history including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease, and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease, and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease e.</p>
<p>Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation.</p>
<p>Psychiatric Adverse Events Pre-Existing Psychosis Administration of stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with pre-existing psychotic disorder.</p>
<p>Prior to initiating treatment with a stimulant, patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. If such symptoms occur, consideration should be given to a possible causal role of the stimulant, and discontinuation of treatment may be appropriate. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies, such symptoms occurred in about 0.</p>
<p>Aggression Aggressive behavior or hostility is often observed in children and adolescents with ADHD, and has been reported in clinical trials and the postmarketing experience of some medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD. Although there is no systematic evidence that stimulants cause aggressive behavior or hostility, patients beginning treatment for ADHD should be monitored for the appearance of or worsening of aggressive behavior or hostility.</p>
<p>Long-Term Suppression of Growth Careful follow-up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non-medication treatment groups over 14 months, as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate-treated and non-medication treated children over 36 months to the ages of 10 to 13 years , suggests that consistently medicated children i.</p>
<p>Higher doses were associated with greater weight loss within the initial 4 weeks of treatment. Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause a similar suppression of growth, however, it is anticipated that they will likely have this effect as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants, and patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted. Seizures There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizure, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in absence of seizures, and very rarely, in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures.</p>
<p>In the presence of seizures, the drug should be discontinued. Visual Disturbance Difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment.</p>
<p>Information for Patients Amphetamines may impair the ability of the patient to engage in potentially hazardous activities such as operating machinery or vehicles; the patient should therefore be cautioned accordingly.</p>
<p>Drug Interactions Acidifying agents -Gastrointestinal acidifying agents guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, etc. Urinary acidifying agents -These agents ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc. Both groups of agents lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines. Adrenergic blockers -Adrenergic blockers are inhibited by amphetamines.</p>
<p>Alkalinizing agents -Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents sodium bicarbonate, etc. Urinary alkalinizing agents acetazolamide, some thiazides increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents increase blood levels and therefore potentiate the actions of amphetamines. Antidepressants, tricyclic -Amphetamines may enhance the activity of tricyclic antidepressants or sympathomimetic agents; d-amphetamine with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain; cardiovascular effects can be potentiated.</p>
<p>In patients with narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder, Adderall provides stimulation to help stay awake during the day. This can be increased or decreased by 5 mg weekly as symptoms and response dictate. The daily dose should not exceed 40 mg daily.</p>
<p>For children 13 to 17 years old age, the recommended beginning dose is 10 mg daily. After one week, this can be adjusted to 20 mg per day if needed. The starting dose of Adderall for narcolepsy in children 6 to 12 years of age is 5 mg daily. The dose might be increased by 5 mg weekly until the optimum result is achieved.</p>
<p>If I were you, I would 20mg XR for my first time, and if that isn't strong enough for you, you'll know to take a little more in the future. Work your way up. If you don't feel 20mg, or if 20mg isn't enough, DON'T take more right away - wait until another day to try more, or at least wait more than two hours. Sometimes it can take longer for it to kick in. Don't make the mistake of taking more if you get impatient after half an hour of waiting for it to kick in, because you'll likely regret this when the first pill finally does kick in.</p>
<p>Don't snort adderall XR. If you're going to take it, swallow it. The reason you don't want to snort adderall XR is because it just isn't a very efficient way to take it. If I'm not mistaken, two of the amphetamine salts don't get absorbed by your mucous membranes and end up just dripping down the back of your throat into your stomach where they get absorbed orally anyways , and the amphetamine that is snortable is so diluted from all the pill binders and fillers, that only a small amount of it actually gets absorbed.</p>
<p>One of the amphetamine salts won't even dissolve in your nose and won't even drip down into your stomach , and you'll be picking it out of your nose for days afterwards. You're mouth is likely going to be very dry and by dry I mean fucking dry , so make sure you have water or something else to drink.</p>
<p>Adderall usually makes a person sweat a lot and pee a lot, so water is especially important to stay hydrated. I would advise against drinking soda or anything with caffeine in it. If you have a penis, its going to get very small and shrivel up, but don't worry this is only temporary and it goes back to normal after the drug leaves your system.</p></p>
