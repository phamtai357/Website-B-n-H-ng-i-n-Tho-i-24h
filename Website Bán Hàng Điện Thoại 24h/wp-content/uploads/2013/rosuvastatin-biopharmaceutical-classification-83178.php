		<p><p>Post Compression Studies of Liquisolid Compacts 3. Since all the prepared formulae met the standard friability criteria, they are expected to show acceptable toughness and withstand abrasion during handling. Generally, the ideal tablet hardness should be produced without applying excessive compression force where rapid tablet disintegration and drug dissolution are maintained at the same time [ 16 ]. Also, the batches passed the USP weight variation test.</p>
<p>All the prepared batches had a disintegration time less than 1 min. The batches prepared with increasing drug concentration exhibited an increasing disintegration time. Based on 6 , value of each liquisolid preparation was calculated.</p>
<p>No liquid vehicle is involved in the case of directly compressed tablets which contain plain micronized RVT powder, and their value was taken as 0. The result of friability, hardness, weight variation, disintegration time, and fraction of molecularly dispersed drug for all the batches of RVT liquisolid compacts are shown in Table 4.</p>
<p>Physical parameter of liquisolid tablet. Wetting Time Wetting time is closely related to the inner structure of the tablets and to the hydrophilicity of the excipient. Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1 , wherein the proportion of the first anti-oxidatively active substance A1 in the pharmaceutical composition amounts from 0.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1 , wherein the ratio of the second anti-oxidatively active substance A2 in the pharmaceutical composition amounts from 0. Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1 , wherein the pharmaceutically active substance is simvastatin.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1 , wherein the first anti-oxidatively active substance A1 is selected from the group consisting of chain terminators, reducing agents, radical scavengers and chelating agents.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 6 , wherein the first anti-oxidatively active substance A1 is at least one chain terminator selected from the group consisting of phenols and phenol ethers such as butylated hydroxyanisole. Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1 , wherein the second anti-oxidatively active substance A2 is a reducing agent.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 8 , wherein the second anti-oxidatively active substance A2 is an organic acid. Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 10 , wherein the quantitative ratio of A1 to A2 amounts from 1: Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1 , wherein the composition is pressed in tablet form, said tablet form optionally having a surface coating.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1 , wherein the composition is present as a film-coated tablet. Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1 , wherein the composition is present as an immediate release tablet.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1 , wherein the composition is filled into a gelatin hard capsule. Method for the treatment of lipid metabolism disorders comprising orally administering a composition of claim 1 to a patient in need thereof.</p>
<p>There are several patent applications and specifications dealing with the formulation problems of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, namely statins, in general.</p>
<p>It is known from the literature that from among HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, lipid-lowering drugs several compounds are sensitive to the properties of the micro-environment of the composition, in fact to light, to heat and humidity. The following patent specifications describe pharmaceutical compositions containing statins, among others rosuvastatin. According to the description the advantage of the amino sugars versus inorganic alkali-earth metal salts is that they do not irritate the mucosa in the intestines.</p>
<p>In the composition according to the invention, it is possible to omit antioxidatively active substances without any disadvantages for the stability of the at least one active ingredient.</p>
<p>Various methods and procedures are known for preventing this, including a suitable choice of the dosage form, a formulation that uses suitable excipients and selecting a suitable packaging. The active ingredient is adequately stabilized by the antioxidants as well as additional excipients in the pharmaceutical composition, usually an oral form.</p>
<p>For example the dosage forms known from the prior art contain a quantity of excipient that may have negative effects on the weight and volume of the dosage form as well as the manufacturing costs due to the amount involved. The greater the amount of excipient, the lower at the same time is the concentration of the active ingredient in the formulation.</p>
<p>Low active ingredient concentrations have the effect that the amount of impurities, for example, degradation products of the active ingredient is increased in relation to the active ingredient. There in general a high active ingredient concentration, i. Statins are used mainly as anticholesterolemics in fat metabolism disorders and have the greatest potency relative to all drugs that influence the lipid metabolism.</p>
<p>For stabilization of statins, they are formulated together with antioxidatively active substances which may be classified primarily with the chain terminators, reductants, radical scavengers or complexing agents.</p>
<p>Thus the formulations known from the prior art usually contain organic acids e. The biopharmaceutical classification system BCS classifies pharmaceutically active substances with regard to their expected bioavailability.</p>
<p>Excipients may be selected from: Starches or modified starches such as sodium starch glycolate, corn starch, potato starch and pregelatinized starch. Sweetener such as mannitol , aspertame. Subliming agent such as camphor. Lubricant such as magnesium stearate. Binder such as Avicel Ph  The selected disintegrates were sodium starch glycolate in the present investigation. Preparation of Cyclodextrin Inclusion Complexes: Then slowly drug is incorporated into the slurry and trituration is further continued for one hour.</p></p>
