		<p><p>Tramadol may produce a set of symptoms similar to opioids, including dizziness, somnolence, nausea, constipation, sweating and pruritus. However, tramadol causes significantly less respiratory depression than morphine. In contrast to morphine, tramadol has not been shown to induce histamine release.</p>
<p>At therapeutic doses, tramadol has no effect on heart rate, left-ventricular function or cardiac index. Different studies have shown: Tramadol may represent a superior choice over morphine for children undergoing adenotonsillectomy, because of its potential to cause less postoperative sedation and respiratory depression 9.</p>
<p>Tramadol is as effective as morphine for moderate postoperative pain but it is less effective for severe acute pain  Tramadol has been compared with morphine in patients with post-traumatic musculoskeletal pain in the pre-hospital setting.</p>
<p>Intravenous tramadol mg was equivalent to morphine mg, with similar incidence of side effects and similar degree of patient satisfaction  Tramadol has the least osteoporotic effect as compared to morphine  Tramadol has smaller inhibitory effect on gastric emptying compared with morphine  Radicular pain Morphine provides greater albeit not statistically significant relief of radicular pain than tramadol  Postoperative analgesia after tonsillectomy Both analgesics are effective for postoperative pain relief in children after tonsillectomy.</p>

<p>Clinical trials in non-malignant pain included patients with osteoarthritis , low back pain , diabetic neuropathy and fibromyalgia. The active controls were included to establish model sensitivity. Collectively, a total of patients with dental pain , patients with surgical pain, patients with chronic malignant pain, patients with sub-acute low back pain, and patients with chronic non-malignant pain were enrolled into the 28 efficacy trials. Of the total patients enrolled into these trials, were randomized to a tramadol treatment arm.</p>
<p>Results of these trials demonstrated statistically superior pain relief for tramadol compared to placebo. Data from these key trials provide information regarding the optimal analgesic dosage range of tramadol.
