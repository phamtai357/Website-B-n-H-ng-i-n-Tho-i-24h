            <h1>Amitriptyline 10mg daily - Company contact details</h1>
        </div>
	 
		<p><p>I have been on antidepressants before and didn't want to go back there. After a few months of basically no sleep I was desperate and decided to give it a go. I have not looked back from then. I take 10mg every night and my sleep has improved greatly.</p>
<p>I have tried to come off it again a couple of times in the last 6 years, but I really need it. I don't get side affects from this low dose either. I would recommend giving it a go. I flushed the first perscription down the toilet because I thought I didn't need it!!!</p>
<p>When I went back to the doctor he explained that it was a sedative at a low dose and that it is one of the best for stopping CF pain and would help me sleep! No asenapine dose adjustments are required during combined use. Moderate Concomitant use of carisoprodol with tricyclic antidepressants can result in additive CNS depression sedation and dizziness , which can impair the ability to undertake tasks requiring mental alertness. Moderate According to the manufacturer, concurrent use of tricyclic antidepressants TCAs and atazanavir may result in elevated TCA plasma concentration, and could increase the potential for serious adverse effects.</p>
<p>If these drugs are administered together, carefully titrate the TCA dose based on a clinical assessment of antidepressant response. Patients on a stable dose of TCA who start treatment with atazanavir should be monitored for TCA-associated anticholinergic effects e.</p>
<p>In addition to clinical monitoring, the manufacturer suggests obtaining TCA serum concentrations where available as an adjunct to assessing the potential for interactions. Moderate Close monitoring for antidepressant response and careful dose titrations of the antidepressant therapy is recommended during coadministration of tricyclic antidepressants TCAs and cobicistat.</p>
<p>Concurrent use may result in elevated TCA plasma concentrations. Minor Atomoxetine should be used cautiously with amitriptyline. QT prolongation has occurred during therapeutic use of atomoxetine and following overdose.</p>
<p>Atomoxetine is considered a drug with a possible risk of torsade de pointes TdP. Severe Per the manufacturer, treatment initiation with amitriptyline is contraindicated in patients currently receiving intravenous IV methylene blue due to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. If urgent psychiatric treatment is required, interventions other than amitriptyline e. Conversely, in patients receiving amitriptyline and requiring urgent treatment with IV methylene blue, amitriptyline should be discontinued immediately and methylene blue therapy initiated only if acceptable alternatives are not available and the potential benefits outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>The patient should be monitored for serotonin syndrome for 2 weeks or until 24 hours after the last dose of methylene blue, whichever comes first. Amitriptyline may be re-initiated 24 hours after the last dose of methylene blue. Results from an in vitro study indicate that methylene blue is a potent, reversible inhibitor of the monoamine oxidase type A enzyme MAO-A.</p>
<p>MAO-A is responsible for the metabolism of serotonin. It is not known if patients receiving other serotonergic psychiatric agents with IV methylene blue are at a comparable risk or if methylene blue administered by other routes e.</p>
<p>Signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome include fever, diaphoresis, shivering, myoclonus, tremor, tachycardia, diarrhea, nausea, headache, incoordination, mental status changes e. Use caution during coadministration. Cases of severe GI reactions including toxic megacolon and adynamic ileus have been rarely reported. In some cases, a dosage reduction of diphenoxylate or difenoxin might be needed to manage any noted side effects.</p>
<p>Moderate Tricyclic antidepressants may antagonize some of the effects of parasympathomimetics, such as edrophonium, due to their anticholinergic activity. Atropine; Hyoscyamine; Phenobarbital; Scopolamine: Moderate An enhanced CNS depressant effect may occur when azelastine is combined with other CNS depressants including tricyclic antidepressants.</p>
<p>Major Due to a possible risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , azithromycin and tricyclic antidepressants TCAs should be used together cautiously. TCAs share pharmacologic properties similar to the Class IA antiarrhythmic agents and may prolong the QT interval, particularly in overdose or with higher-dose prescription therapy elevated serum concentrations.</p>
<p>There have been case reports of QT prolongation and TdP with the use of azithromycin in postmarketing reports. Concurrent use may increase the risk of QT prolongation. Moderate Concomitant use of baclofen with other CNS depressants, such as tricyclic antidepressants, can result in additive CNS depression.</p>
<p>In addition, simultaneous use of baclofen and tricyclic antidepressants may cause muscle hypotonia. Minor Due to the potential for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP , caution is advised when administering bedaquiline with tricyclic antidepressants. Both bedaquiline and tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to prolong the QT interval.</p>
<p>Prior to initiating bedaquiline, obtain serum electrolyte concentrations and a baseline ECG. An ECG should also be performed at least 2, 12, and 24 weeks after starting bedaquiline therapy. Belladonna Alkaloids; Ergotamine; Phenobarbital: In some cases, additive effects can lead to oversedation, hypoventilation and respiratory depression, hypotension, and coma. Constipation may also occur. When such combination therapy is contemplated, the dosage of one or both agents should be reduced.</p>
<p>Severe Bepridil is contraindicated for use with other drugs that might prolong the QT interval, as bepridil is associated with an established risk for QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP. Bismuth Subcitrate Potassium; Metronidazole; Tetracycline: Minor Coadministration of metronidazole with tricyclic antidepressants TCAs may increase the risk for QT prolongation.</p>
<p>Potential QT prolongation has been reported in limited case reports with metronidazole. Tricyclic antidepressants share pharmacologic properties similar to the Class IA antiarrhythmic agents and may prolong the QT interval, particularly in overdose or with higher-dose prescription therapy elevated serum concentrations.</p>
<p>Bismuth Subsalicylate; Metronidazole; Tetracycline: Moderate Close clinical monitoring is advised when administering amitriptyline with boceprevir due to an increased potential for amitriptyline-related adverse events.</p>
<p>If amitriptyline dose adjustments are made, re-adjust the dose upon completion of boceprevir treatment. Although this interaction has not been studied, predictions about the interaction can be made based on the metabolic pathway of amitriptyline.</p>
<p>Amitriptyline is a substrate of the drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein PGP and of the hepatic isoenzyme CYP3A4; boceprevir is an inhibitor of both the efflux protein and the isoenzyme. Coadministration may result in elevated amitriptyline plasma concentrations. Severe The use of bretylium in conjunction with drugs associated with QT prolongation is not advised due to the potential risk for ventricular tachycardia, including torsade de pointes TdP.</p>
<p>Tricyclic antidepressants TCAs have been reported to prolong the QT interval, particularly in overdose or with higher-dose prescription therapy elevated serum concentrations. Cases of long QT syndrome and TdP have been described with TCA and related compounds, but rarely occur when the drugs are used alone in normal prescribed doses and in the absence of other known risk factors for QT prolongation.</p>
<p>Limited data are available regarding the safety of these antidepressants in combination with other QT-prolonging drugs. Moderate Due to the CNS effects of brexpiprazole, caution is advisable when brexpiprazole is given in combination with other centrally-acting medications including tricyclic antidepressants. Sedation is generally more pronounced with tertiary agents such as amitriptyline, imipramine, doxepin, and clomipramine.</p>
<p>Similar precautions apply to combination products such as amitriptyline; chlordiazepoxide. Moderate Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to decrease the antihypertensive effects of systemic clonidine. It is not known whether tricyclic antidepressants will affect the IOP-lowering efficacy of brimonidine eye solution. There are no data concerning the levels of systemic catecholamines after ophthalmic administration of brimonidine; however, monitor patients carefully who are taking brimonidine and tricyclic antidepressants.</p>
<p>Monitor patients on anticonvulsants carefully when a TCA is used concurrently. Moderate Drowsiness has been reported during administration of carbetapentane. An enhanced CNS depressant effect may occur when carbetapentane is combined with other CNS depressants including tricyclic antidepressants.</p>
<p>Major Coadminister bupivacaine and tricyclic antidepressants together with caution. If epinephrine is added to bupivacaine, severe and prolonged hypertension may occur in a patient taking a TCA.</p>
<p>Tricyclic antidepressants can increase the sensitivity to epinephrine by inhibiting epinephrine reuptake or metabolism. If concurrent therapy is necessary, carefully monitor the patient.</p>
<p>Major If epinephrine is added to lidocaine for the purpose of infiltration and nerve block or spinal anesthesia, receipt of the product to a patient taking tricyclic antidepressants TCA may lead to severe, prolonged hypertension. In general, concurrent use of a local anesthetic solution containing epinephrine and a TCA should be avoided.</p>
<p>If coadministration is necessary, careful patient monitoring is essential. Major Due to the potential for QT prolongation and additive CNS depressant effects, cautious use and close monitoring are advisable if concurrent use of tricyclic antidepressants TCAs and buprenorphine is necessary. Buprenorphine has been associated with QT prolongation and has a possible risk of torsade de pointes TdP.</p>
<p>FDA-approved labeling for some buprenorphine products recommend avoiding use with Class 1A and Class III antiarrhythmic medications while other labels recommend avoiding use with any drug that has the potential to prolong the QT interval. In addition, concurrent use of opioids with other drugs that modulate serotonergic function, such as TCAs, has resulted in serotonin syndrome in some cases.</p>
<p>If combination treatment is required, patients should be carefully observed, particularly during treatment initiation and during dose adjustments of the serotonergic drug; discontinue buprenorphine if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Prior to concurrent use of buprenorphine in patients taking a CNS depressant, assess the level of tolerance to CNS depression that has developed, the duration of use, and the patient's overall response to treatment.</p>
<p>Evaluate the patient's use of alcohol or illicit drugs. Consider a dose reduction of one or both drugs. Monitor patients for sedation or respiratory depression. Major Bupropion may interact with tricyclic antidepressants TCAs. The manufacturer of bupropion warns of using any TCAs with bupropion due to the potential for increased risk of seizures from the lowering of seizure threshold. Bupropion-induced elevations in both imipramine and desipramine plasma concentrations may occur. TCA half-lives have increased in pharmacokinetic studies.</p>
<p>The anticholinergic effects of bupropion may also be additive with those of the TCAs. Prolonged seizure activity has been reported following the combined use clomipramine and bupropion. The manufacturer recommends low initial dosing and slow dosage titration if these drugs must be used concurrently; the patient should be closely monitored.</p>
<p>Major Because of the potential risk and severity of serotonin syndrome, caution should be observed when administering tricyclic antidepressants TCAs with other drugs that have serotonergic properties such as buspirone. Buspirone increases the sensitivity of postsynaptic serotonin receptors and TCAs inhibit the reuptake of serotonin. If a CNS depressant needs to be used with butorphanol, use the smallest effective dose and the longest dosing frequency of butorphanol.</p>
<p>Minor The prolactin-lowering effect of cabergoline may be antagonized by medications that increase prolactin levels such as tricyclic antidepressants. Moderate Use caution if coadministration of capecitabine with amitriptyline is necessary, and monitor for an increase in amitriptyline-related adverse reactions such as nausea, dizziness, hypotension, syncope, and QT prolongation.</p>
<p>Moderate Concomitant use of metaxalone with tricyclic antidepressants can result in additive CNS depression. Moderate Tricyclic antidepressants, when used concomitantly with anticonvulsants, can increase CNS depression and may also lower the seizure threshold. In addition, carbamazepine may increase tricyclic antidepressant metabolism.</p>
<p>Moderate Tricyclic antidepressants exhibit antimuscarinic activity and can decrease gastric motility, decreasing the bioavailability of levodopa. In addition, severe hypertension occurred in a limited number of patients who received levodopa in combination with a tricyclic antidepressant.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic interactions have not been reported. No pharmacokinetic interaction with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine was shown in a single-dose study with entacapone. Tolcapone did not change the pharmacokinetics of desipramine in a drug interaction study. Moderate Due to the CNS effects of cariprazine, caution is advisable when cariprazine is given in combination with other centrally-acting medications including tricyclic antidepressants.</p>
<p>Minor Periodically monitor electrolytes and ECGs in patients receiving concomitant treatment with ceritinib and amitriptyline; an interruption of therapy, dose reduction, or discontinuation of therapy may be necessary if QT prolongation occurs. Ceritinib causes concentration-dependent prolongation of the QT interval. Moderate Cetirizine and levocetirizine are considered low-sedating antihistamines.</p>
<p>Additive drowsiness may occur if cetirizine or levocetirizine are administered with other drugs that depress the CNS, including the tricyclic antidepressants TCAs. Antihistamines and TCAs may also exhibit additive anticholinergic effects, which may commonly result in dry mouth, constipation, and occasionally blurred vision or urinary retention.</p>
<p>Major Coadminister chloroquine with other drugs known to prolong the QT interval, such as tricyclic antidepressants TCAs , with caution. Chloroquine is associated with an increased risk of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP ; fatalities have been reported. The risk of QT prolongation is increased with higher chloroquine doses. Chlorpheniramine; Guaifenesin; Hydrocodone; Pseudoephedrine: Moderate When prescribing tricyclic antidepressants TCAs to patients already receiving phenothiazine therapy including chlorpromazine, close monitoring is essential and dose reduction may become necessary to avoid toxicity.</p>
<p>Lower doses than usually prescribed for either the phenothiazine or the TCA may be required. TCAs may impair metabolism via the hepatic isoenzyme CYP2D6 at therapeutic doses and may result in increased serum phenothiazine concentrations, leading to side effects. Depending on the specific agent, additive anticholinergic effects may also be seen; clinicians should note that antimuscarinic effects may be seen not only on GI smooth muscle, but also on bladder function, the eye, and temperature regulation.</p>
<p>Additive drowsiness or other additive CNS effects may also occur. In addition, TCAs may also cause additive cardiac effects e. Chlorpromazine is specifically associated with an established risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes TdP ; case reports have included patients receiving therapeutic doses of chlorpromazine. Major Concurrent use of clonidine with tricyclic antidepressants TCAs should be avoided when possible, due to multiple possible interactions.</p>
<p>Clonidine's antihypertensive effect can be reduced by TCAs; occasionally, the hypertension will occur within the first few days of combined therapy. If coadministration of a TCA with clonidine cannot be avoided, the patient should be closely monitored for increased blood pressure and clonidine dosages adjusted as needed. In rats, the coadministration of amitriptyline with clonidine resulted in corneal lesions, but the human implications of these animal study findings are unknown. Moderate Cimetidine can inhibit the hepatic clearance of some tricyclic antidepressants that undergo oxidative metabolism, including amitriptyline.</p>
<p>Choose an alternate H2-blocker when possible; alternatively, observe patients closely for TCA-induced side effects or toxicity if the concurrent use of cimetidine is unavoidable. Moderate Cinacalcet, a strong in vitro inhibitor of the CYP2D6 cytochrome P enzyme, may theoretically increase serum concentrations of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme, such as tricyclic antidepressants. Minor Rare cases of QT prolongation and torsade de pointe TdP have been reported with ciprofloxacin during post-marketing surveillance.</p>
<p>Ciprofloxacin should be used with caution in patients receiving drugs that prolong the QT interval. Drugs with a possible risk for QT prolongation and TdP that should be used cautiously with ciprofloxacin include the tricyclic antidepressants TCAs.</p>
<p>Severe QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes TdP and death, have been reported with cisapride. Because of the potential for TdP, use of tricyclic antidepressants TCAs with cisapride is contraindicated.</p>
<p>In addition to adverse cardiac effects, the antimuscarinic effects of the TCAs may hinder the therapeutic actions of cisapride on GI motility. Major Citalopram causes dose-dependent QT interval prolongation and tricyclic antidepressants are associated with a possible risk of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes TdP. According to the manufacturer, concurrent use of citalopram with other drugs that prolong the QT interval is not recommended.</p>
<p>If concurrent therapy is considered essential, ECG monitoring is recommended. In addition, because of the potential risk and severity of serotonin syndrome, caution should be observed when administering citalopram with other drugs that have serotonergic properties such as tricyclic antidepressants. Citalopram is a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6, the isoenzyme responsible for metabolism of many of the tricyclic antidepressants. Coadministration of citalopram and imipramine did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of either drug.</p>
<p>The clinical significance of the elevation in desipramine concentration is unknown. However, symptoms of toxicity, including seizures, have been reported when drugs from these 2 classes were used together.</p>
<p>Moderate A dosage reduction of CYP2D6 substrates, such tricyclic antidepressants, may be necessary during co-administration of clobazam.</p>
<p>Limited in vivo data suggest that clobazam is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Additive CNS depressant effects are possible when clobazam is administered concurrently with tricyclic antidepressants. Moderate Concurrent use of clozapine and tricyclic antidepressants should be avoided if possible. Treatment with clozapine has been associated with QT prolongation, torsade de pointes TdP , cardiac arrest, and sudden death.</p>
<p>Tricyclic antidepressants have a possible risk of QT prolongation particularly with elevated concentrations. The manufacturer of clozapine recommends caution during concurrent use with medications known to cause QT prolongation.</p>
<p>Depending on the specific agent, additive anticholinergic effects may be seen when clozapine is used concomitantly with other drugs known to possess antimuscarinic activity like tricyclic antidepressants. Additive hypotension or sedation is also possible when clozapine is combined with these drugs. Anticholinergic effects are most prominent with tertiary TCAs such as amitriptyline, clomipramine, imipramine, and doxepin.</p>
<p>Cobicistat; Elvitegravir; Emtricitabine; Tenofovir Alafenamide: Moderate Promethazine carries a risk of QT prolongation and should be used cautiously with drugs that may prolong the QT interval and have additive anticholinergic properties such as the tricyclic antidepressants. Additive drowsiness and sedation may also occur. Clinicians should note that additive anticholinergic effects may be seen not only on GI smooth muscle, but also on bladder function, the eye, and temperature regulation.</p>
<p>Minor The oxidative metabolism of tricyclic antidepressants may be decreased by ethinyl estradiol. Increased antidepressant serum concentrations may occur. Ethinyl estradiol has been reported to intensify side effects from imipramine. Patients should be monitored for increased tricyclic antidepressant side effects if an estrogen is added. Current evidence indicates that this interaction may be related to the estrogen dosage, with larger doses i.</p>
<p>An interruption of therapy, dose reduction, or discontinuation of therapy may be necessary for crizotinib patients if QT prolongation occurs. Crizotinib has been associated with concentration-dependent QT prolongation. Moderate Cyclobenzaprine is structurally and pharmacologically similar to tricyclic antidepressants TCAs such as amitriptyline.</p>
<p>Similar effects include antimuscarinic actions such as dry mouth, urinary difficulty, and impairment of gastrointestinal motility. As with the TCAs, cardiac adverse effects of cyclobenzaprine including prolongation of the QT interval would be expected in overdose or in cases of excessive pharmacology.</p>
<p>Sedation Another Amitriptyline side effect is sedation where a person can feel fatigue, tired, sleepy and sedated. This also reacts together with a slower metabolism and fat storage change, so when you sleep more and exercise less, there are more chances you will gain weight. Taste Perception Alteration After resolving depression, patients can have a feel of the better taste of food since they are in a better mood and they can start to eat more and larger portions which can result in weight gain.</p>
<p>Factors Which Affect Weight Gain When Taking Amitriptyline Though it is very individual, some factors are well known to influence on weight gain occurrence when taking this medication. Dosage This is a logical one and the weight gain side effect is linked with higher dosages of Amitriptyline.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is recommended to take minimal effective dosage which your doctor will prescribe you. Duration Of Intake This is another important factor, where those who have been taking this medication for a long time will have more potential of getting weight than those who are in a short amount of time on a therapy.</p>
<p>There is also the possibility of tolerance development due to a time span, so patients tend to increase their dosage, which can also lead to a risk of weight gain. Genetics It is important to state that individual differences between people taking this drug and link with weight gain can have to do with genetics.</p>
<p>Some people are more prone to fat storage than others, depending on their DNA. Take amitriptyline exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Follow all directions on your prescription label.</p>
<p>Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. It may take up to 4 weeks before your symptoms improve. Keep using the medication as directed and tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve. If you need surgery, tell the surgeon ahead of time that you are using amitriptyline. You may need to stop using the medicine for a short time.</p>
<p>Do not stop using amitriptyline suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.</p></p>
