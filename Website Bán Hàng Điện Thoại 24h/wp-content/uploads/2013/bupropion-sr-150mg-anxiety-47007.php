<p>Top of Page This information does not replace the advice of a doctor. Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy Category C Risk Summary Data from epidemiological studies of pregnant women exposed to bupropion in the first trimester indicate no increased risk of congenital malformations overall.</p>
<p>No clear evidence of teratogenic activity was found in reproductive developmental studies conducted in rats and rabbits; however, in rabbits, slightly increased incidences of fetal malformations and skeletal variations were observed at doses approximately equal to the maximum recommended human dose MRHD and greater and decreased fetal weights were seen at doses twice the MRHD and greater.</p>
<p>Clinical Considerations Consider the risks of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medications during pregnancy and postpartum. Human Data Data from the international bupropion Pregnancy Registry first-trimester exposures and a retrospective cohort study using the United Healthcare database 1, first trimester exposures did not show an increased risk for malformations overall. No increased risk for cardiovascular malformations overall has been observed after bupropion exposure during the first trimester.</p>
<p>The prospectively observed rate of cardiovascular malformations in pregnancies with exposure to bupropion in the first trimester from the international Pregnancy Registry was 1.</p>
<p>Data from the United Healthcare database and a case-control study 6, infants with cardiovascular malformations and 5, with non-cardiovascular malformations from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study NBDPS did not show an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations overall after bupropion exposure during the first trimester.</p>
<p>Study findings on bupropion exposure during the first trimester and risk for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction LVOTO are inconsistent and do not allow conclusions regarding a possible association. Study findings on bupropion exposure during the first trimester and risk for ventricular septal defect VSD are inconsistent and do not allow conclusions regarding a possible association. For the findings of LVOTO and VSD, the studies were limited by the small number of exposed cases, inconsistent findings among studies, and the potential for chance findings from multiple comparisons in case control studies.</p>
<p>Animal Data In studies conducted in rats and rabbits, bupropion was administered orally during the period of organogenesis at doses of up to and mg per kg per day, respectively approximately 11 and 7 times the MRHD, respectively, on a mg per m2 basis. No clear evidence of teratogenic activity was found in either species; however, in rabbits, slightly increased incidences of fetal malformations and skeletal variations were observed at the lowest dose tested 25 mg per kg per day, approximately equal to the MRHD on a mg per m2 basis and greater.</p>
<p>Decreased fetal weights were observed at 50 mg per kg and greater. When rats were administered bupropion at oral doses of up to mg per kg per day approximately 7 times the MRHD on a mg per m2 basis prior to mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation, there were no apparent adverse effects on offspring development.</p>
<p>Nursing Mothers Bupropion and its metabolites are present in human milk. In a lactation study of 10 women, levels of orally dosed bupropion and its active metabolites were measured in expressed milk.</p>
<p>No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>Bupropion is extensively metabolized in the liver to active metabolites, which are further metabolized and excreted by the kidneys. Anyone have similar issues? Read More Anyone have any experience with taking Chantix Varenicline or Zyban bupropion to quit smoking? From what I've read it seems Zyban works better and Chantix is a fairly new drug for it. Varenicline is a partial antagonist of the niACH receptor and Bupropion is an antidepressant that acts as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and nicotinic antagonist.</p>
<p>Seems to me thought that the Bupr. Read More put me on bupropion -around the same time I started going thru some really hard personal stuff. The anxiety hit me hard as well as a new symptom that I refer to as crying jags.</p>
<p>I started counseling and have been re-learning coping skills, stress management, etc. I have been dealing with this since early adolecence and I am now in my late 20's. I have had episodes of Major depression during that time , and possibly 2 episodes of a light mania?</p>
<p>I am not sure if I am bi-polar. I was treated for postpartum depression after my second son and put on Paxil for anxiety with mild depression 4 years ago.</p></p>
