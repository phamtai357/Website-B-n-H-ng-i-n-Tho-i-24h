		<p><p>Hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of the stomach moves up into the chest through a small opening in the diaphragm diaphragmatic hiatus. The diaphragm is the muscle separating the abdomen from the chest. Recent studies show that the opening in the diaphragm helps support the lower end of the esophagus. Many people with a hiatal hernia will not have problems with heartburn or reflux.</p>
<p>But having a hiatal hernia may allow stomach contents to reflux more easily into the esophagus. Coughing , vomiting , straining, or sudden physical exertion can cause increased pressure in the abdomen resulting in hiatal hernia. Obesity and pregnancy also contribute to this condition. Many otherwise healthy people age 50 and over have a small hiatal hernia.</p>
<p>Although considered a condition of middle age, hiatal hernias affect people of all ages. Hiatal hernias usually do not require treatment. However, treatment may be necessary if the hernia is in danger of becoming strangulated twisted in a way that cuts off blood supply or is complicated by severe GERD or esophagitis inflammation of the esophagus.</p>
<p>The doctor may perform surgery to reduce the size of the hernia or to prevent strangulation. Dietary and lifestyle choices may contribute to GERD. Certain foods and beverages, including chocolate , peppermint, fried or fatty foods, coffee, or alcoholic beverages, may trigger reflux and heartburn.</p>
<p>Studies show that cigarette smoking relaxes the LES. Obesity and pregnancy can also play a role in GERD symptoms. What Are the Symptoms of Heartburn? Heartburn, also called acid indigestion , is the most common symptom of GERD and usually feels like a burning chest pain beginning behind the breastbone and moving upward to the neck and throat.</p>
<p>Many people say it feels like food is coming back into the mouth leaving an acid or bitter taste. The burning, pressure, or pain of heartburn can last as long as 2 hours and is often worse after eating. Lying down or bending over can also result in heartburn. Many people obtain relief by standing upright or by taking an antacid that clears acid out of the esophagus.</p>
<p>Heartburn pain is sometimes mistaken for the pain associated with heart disease or a heart attack , but there are differences. Exercise may aggravate pain resulting from heart disease , and rest may relieve the pain. Heartburn pain is less likely to be associated with physical activity. More than 60 million American adults experience heartburn at least once a month, and more than 15 million adults suffer daily from heartburn.</p>
<p>Many pregnant women experience daily heartburn. Recent studies show that GERD in infants and children is more common than previously recognized and may produce recurrent vomiting , coughing , and other respiratory problems. The remedies used are as follows: Nat Phos 6x dose tablets taken immediately after each of 2 meals Arnica 30c in the Wet dose taken twice daily. You can expect relief from your ailment hopefully within a few hours. Do not eat large meals. Eat small meals but more often if you feel hungry.</p>
<p>Do not drink more that a few sips of water after your meals. This is to prevent the further dilution of your gastric juice which can then reflux into your Esophagus which results in GERD. Pepcid AC combined with an antacid calcium carbonate and magnesium is available as Pepcid Complete. Proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers: Doctors sometimes recommend a nighttime dose of an H2 blocker for people who are taking PPIs twice a day. This is based on the belief that adding the H2 blocker will prevent a rise in acid reflux at night.</p>
<p>However, one study reported no additional benefits from the nighttime H2 blocker. Some experts recommended that patients who are on PPIs take an H2 blocker only to prevent breakthrough symptoms, such as before a heavy meal.</p>
<p>In most cases, these medications have good safety profiles and few side effects. H2 blockers can interact with other drugs, although some less so than others. In all cases, the physician should be made aware of any other drugs a patient is taking. Anyone with kidney problems should use famotidine only under a doctor's direction. More research is needed into the effects of long-term use of these medications.</p>
<p>Some experts are concerned that the use of acid-blocking drugs in people with peptic ulcers may mask ulcer symptoms and increase the risk for serious complications. These drugs do not protect against Barrett's esophagus. Also of concern are reports that long-term acid suppression with these drugs may cause cancerous changes in the stomach in patients who are infected with H. Research on this question is still ongoing. This can pose a danger to people with kidney problems.</p>
<p>The FDA and Health Canada are advising physicians to reduce the dose and increase the time between doses in patients with kidney failure. Use of the drug in those with impaired kidney function can affect the central nervous system and may result in anxiety, depression, insomnia or drowsiness, and mental disturbances.</p>
<p>Medications that Protect the Mucus Lining Sucralfate Sucralfate Carafate protects the mucus lining in the gastrointestinal tract. It seems to work by sticking to an ulcer crater and protecting it from the damaging effects of stomach acid and pepsin. Sucralfate may be helpful for maintenance therapy in people with mild-to-moderate GERD.</p>
<p>Other than constipation, the drug has few side effects. Sucralfate interacts with a wide variety of drugs, however, including warfarin, phenytoin, and tetracycline.</p></p>
