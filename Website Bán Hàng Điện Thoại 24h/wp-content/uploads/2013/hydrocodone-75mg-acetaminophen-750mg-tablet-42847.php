		<p><p>So I came down with an infection and among the medicine I am also taking is a cough syrup which wasn't covered by insurance, HIstinex HC, 2 tsp. Ingredients are listed as: I mean can cause me have miscarriage..</p>
<p>Liquids are available also. Usually with 5mg pills your prescribed 2 pills equaling 10mg hydro and 1,mg apap every hours depending on your DR's preference. When I first started taking them I had no idea what those numbers ment and always thought the same thing.</p>
<p>Because of allergies and sensitivities to many medications, I pretty much ended up on Vicodin as a last resort. If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response.</p>
<p>If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined.</p>
<p>Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs.</p>
<p>Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients.</p>
<p>Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients. Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Pregnancy Category C — There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.</p>
<p>Hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<p>Nonteratogenic Effects — Babies born to mothers who have been taking opioids regularly prior to delivery will be physically dependent. The withdrawal signs include irritability and excessive crying, tremors, hyperactive reflexes, increased respiratory rate, increased stools, sneezing, yawning, vomiting, and fever.</p>
<p>The intensity of the syndrome does not always correlate with the duration of maternal opioid use or dose. Acetaminophen inhibits prostaglandin synthetase.</p>
<p>Therapeutic doses of acetaminophen have negligible effects on the cardiovascular or respiratory systems; however, toxic doses may cause circulatory failure and rapid, shallow breathing. Pharmacokinetics — The behavior of the individual components is described below. Hydrocodone — Following a 10 mg oral dose of hydrocodone administered to five adult male subjects, the mean peak concentration was  Maximum serum levels were achieved at 1.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen — Acetaminophen is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is distributed throughout most body tissues. The plasma half-life is 1. Elimination of acetaminophen is principally by liver metabolism conjugation and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites. Hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets are indicated for the relief of moderate to moderately severe pain. This product should not be administered to patients who have previously exhibited hypersensitivity to hydrocodone or acetaminophen.</p>
<p>Patients known to be hypersensitive to other opioids may exhibit cross-sensitivity to hydrocodone. Respiratory Depression — At high doses or in sensitive patients, hydrocodone may produce dose-related respiratory depression by acting directly on the brain stem respiratory center. Hydrocodone also affects the center that controls respiratory rhythm, and may produce irregular and periodic breathing. Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure — The respiratory depressant effects of narcotics and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, narcotics produce adverse reactions which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries. Acute Abdominal Conditions — The administration of narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.</p>
<p>Special Risk Patients — As with any narcotic analgesic agent, hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets should be used with caution in elderly or debilitated patients, and those with severe impairment of hepatic or renal function, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture.</p>
<p>The usual precautions should be observed and the possibility of respiratory depression should be kept in mind. Since acetaminophen and hydrocodone is taken as needed, you may not be on a dosing schedule. If you are taking the medication regularly, take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not use extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p>
<p>What happens if I overdose? Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at  An overdose of acetaminophen and hydrocodone can be fatal. The first signs of an acetaminophen overdose include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, sweating, and confusion or weakness.</p>
<p>Later symptoms may include pain in your upper stomach, dark urine, and yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes. Overdose symptoms may also include extreme drowsiness, pinpoint pupils, cold and clammy skin, muscle weakness, fainting, weak pulse, slow heart rate, coma, blue lips, shallow breathing, or no breathing What should I avoid while taking acetaminophen and hydrocodone?</p>
<p>This medication may impair your thinking or reactions. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how acetaminophen and hydrocodone will affect you. Dizziness or severe drowsiness can cause falls or other accidents. Ask a doctor or pharmacist before using any other cold, allergy, pain, or sleep medication.</p></p>
