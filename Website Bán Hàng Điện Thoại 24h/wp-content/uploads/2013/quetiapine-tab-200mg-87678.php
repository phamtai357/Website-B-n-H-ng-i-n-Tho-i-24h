If you already have diabetes, check your blood sugar regularly as directed and share the results with your doctor. Your doctor may need to adjust your diabetes medication, exercise program, or diet.</p>
<p>Seroquel Quetiapine mg may also cause significant weight gain and a rise in your blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels. These effects, along with diabetes, may increase your risk for developing heart disease. Discuss the risks and benefits of treatment with your doctor. See also Notes section. Seroquel Quetiapine mg may rarely cause a condition known as tardive dyskinesia. In some cases, this condition may be permanent. Seroquel Quetiapine mg may rarely cause a very serious condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome NMS.</p>
<p>Get medical help right away if you have any of the following symptoms: Seroquel Quetiapine mg may increase a certain natural substance prolactin made by your body. For males, it may result in decreased sexual ability, inability to produce sperm, or enlarged breasts.</p>
<p>If you develop any of these symptoms, tell your doctor right away. Rarely, males may have a painful or prolonged erection lasting 4 or more hours.

In Canada - Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to Health Canada at  Click here to view a more detailed list of Quetiapine side effects.</p>
<p>Orthostatic Hypotension Patients should be advised of the risk of orthostatic hypotension symptoms include feeling dizzy or lightheaded upon standing, which may lead to falls , especially during the period of initial dose titration, and also at times of re-initiating treatment or increases in dose [see Warnings and Precautions 5.</p>
<p>Increased Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents Children and adolescent patients should have their blood pressure measured at the beginning of, and periodically during, treatment [see Warnings and Precautions 5.</p>
<p>Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance Patients should be advised of the risk of somnolence or sedation which may lead to falls , especially during the period of initial dose titration. Patients should be cautioned about performing any activity requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle including automobiles or operating machinery, until they are reasonably certain quetiapine therapy does not affect them adversely.</p>
<p>Heat Exposure and Dehydration Patients should be advised regarding appropriate care in avoiding overheating and dehydration [see Warnings and Precautions 5.</p>
<p>Concomitant Medication As with other medications, patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs. Pregnancy and Nursing Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy with quetiapine.</p>
<p>Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program Quetiapine is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for adolescents with schizophrenia and pediatric bipolar disorder that may include other measures psychological, educational, and social.</p>
<p>Effectiveness and safety of quetiapine have not been established in pediatric patients less than 13 years of age for schizophrenia or less than 10 years of age for bipolar mania. Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is often helpful. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or your treatment. Stop using the drug immediately and seek medical help if you are sweating or are experiencing rigid muscles, tremors, uncontrollable jerky muscle movements, trouble swallowing, blurred vision, seeing halos around lights, eye pain, increased urination and thirst, excessive hunger, flu symptoms like chills, fever and body ache, white patches, and sores on your lips or inside the mouth, and fruity breath.</p>
<p>Precautions You may get suicidal thoughts, especially during the first few weeks of starting the medicine, particularly if you are less than 24 years of age.</p>
<p>Seroquel should not be taken in tandem with medications for psychotic conditions associated with dementia. The drug may lead to heart failure, pneumonia or sudden death in older patients with dementia conditions. You should also inform your doctor if you are already suffering from kidney or liver disease, heart disease, heart rhythm problems, high blood pressure, thyroid disorder, seizure, epilepsy, cataract, triglycerides, high cholesterol, diabetes or face problems while swallowing.</p>
<p>In addition, inform your doctor if you have a history of heart attack or stroke or a low white blood cell count. As the drug causes dizziness, you should avoid driving a vehicle or doing any such activity which requires you to be fully alert. Seroquel Dosage Initially, you will have to take Seroquel 25mg twice a day, but after that, the dose may be increased to Seroquel 50mg times per day.</p>
<p>QT prolongation In clinical trials and use in accordance with the SPC, quetiapine was not associated with a persistent increase in absolute QT intervals. In post marketing, QT prolongation was reported with quetiapine at the therapeutic doses see section 4. As with other antipsychotics, caution should be exercised when quetiapine is prescribed in patients with cardiovascular disease or family history of QT prolongation.</p>
<p>Also caution should be exercised when quetiapine is prescribed either with medicines known to increase QT interval or with concomitant neuroleptics, especially in the elderly, in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, congestive heart failure, heart hypertrophy, hypokalaemia or hypomagnesaemia see Section 4. Cardiomyopathy and myocarditis Cardiomyopathy and myocarditis have been reported in clinical trials and during the post-marketing experience, however, a causal relationship to quetiapine has not been established.</p>
<p>Treatment with quetiapine should be reassessed in patients with suspected cardiomyopathy or myocarditis. Withdrawal Acute withdrawal symptoms such as insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhoea, vomiting, dizziness, and irritability have been described after abrupt cessation of quetiapine. Gradual withdrawal over a period of at least one to two weeks is advisable see section 4. Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis Quetiapine is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis.</p>
<p>An approximately 3-fold increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events has been seen in randomised placebo controlled trials in the dementia population with some atypical antipsychotics. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for other antipsychotics or other patient populations. Quetiapine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for stroke. In a meta-analysis of atypical antipsychotics, it has been reported that elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis are at an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</p>
<p>The patients in these trials died from a variety of causes that were consistent with expectations for this population. Dysphagia Dysphagia see section 4. Quetiapine should be used with caution in patients at risk for aspiration pneumonia. Constipation and intestinal obstruction Constipation represents a risk factor for intestinal obstruction. Constipation and intestinal obstruction have been reported with quetiapine see section 4.</p>
<p>Since patients treated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during treatment with quetiapine and preventive measures undertaken. Pancreatitis Pancreatitis has been reported in clinical trials and during post marketing experience. Among post marketing reports, while not all cases were confounded by risk factors, many patients had factors which are known to be associated with pancreatitis such as increased triglycerides see section 4.</p>
<p>Additional information Quetiapine data in combination with divalproex or lithium in acute moderate to severe manic episodes is limited; however, combination therapy was well tolerated see section 4. The data showed an additive effect at week 3. Lactose Seroquel XR tablets contain lactose.</p>
<p>Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. Misuse and abuse Cases of misuse and abuse have been reported. Caution may be needed when prescribing quetiapine to patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse. Caution should be exercised treating patients receiving other medications having anti-cholinergic muscarinic effects see section 4.</p>
<p>Cytochrome P CYP 3A4 is the enzyme that is primarily responsible for the cytochrome P mediated metabolism of quetiapine. In an interaction study in healthy volunteers, concomitant administration of quetiapine dosage of 25 mg with ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, caused a 5- to 8-fold increase in the AUC of quetiapine.</p>
<p>On the basis of this, concomitant use of quetiapine with CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated. It is also not recommended to consume grapefruit juice while on quetiapine therapy. In a multiple-dose trial in patients to assess the pharmacokinetics of quetiapine given before and during treatment with carbamazepine a known hepatic enzyme inducer , co-administration of carbamazepine significantly increased the clearance of quetiapine. As a consequence of this interaction, lower plasma concentrations can occur, which could affect the efficacy of quetiapine therapy.</p>
<p>The pharmacokinetics of quetiapine were not significantly altered by co-administration of the antipsychotics risperidone or haloperidol.</p></p>
