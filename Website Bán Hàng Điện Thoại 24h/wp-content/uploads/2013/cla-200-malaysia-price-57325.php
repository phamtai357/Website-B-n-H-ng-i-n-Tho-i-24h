            <h1>Cla 200 malaysia price - Used Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class By Year</h1>
        </div>
	 
		<p><p>Dynamic looks from all angles are ensured by the powerful AMG bodystyling comprising front apron, rear apron and side sill panels plus a diamond radiator grille with chrome pins and the twin-pipe exhaust system with chrome-plated tailpipe trim. The lowered sports suspension improves handling and increases driving pleasure. The CLA is equipped with diamond radiator grille in chrome pins, plus a new front bumper with chrome trim strip.</p>
<p>The tailpipe trim panels themselves are now integrated flush into the bumper. All CLA models come standard with inch wheels with run-flat tires, a sport-tuned suspension, cruise control, a power-adjustable driver's seat, Bluetooth, and MB-Tex upholstery. That equips them commensurately with other entries in the segment.</p>
<p>The only odd omission we found was the lack of a power-adjustable front passenger seat, even as an option. Options are available both as individual selections and bundled into various packages that combine popular features together. The Premium package, for example, includes surround sound, an iPod interface with satellite radio, heated front seats, dual-zone climate control, and a garage-door opener. A panoramic sunroof with a thin fabric sunshade is a stand-alone option, as are blind-spot monitors, parking assist, and heated front seats.</p>
<p>Other trim and styling choices go beyond the usual shades of gray paint. Black ash and burl walnut trim can be chosen to replace the grey plastic dash trim. One of the more interesting, if questionable, dealer-installed options is an illuminated three-pointed star for the grille.</p>
<p>A sport-appearance package adds AMG-style inch wheels and its own lower front-end treatment, to the standard sporty grille texturing. The wheels are offered by themselves as well. Its standard features are similar to those on the CLA, but it adds the unique and far more powerful engine, standard all-wheel drive, AMG suspension and chassis hardware, and a number of additional options not offered on the  CLA45 AMG options include Recaro sports seats—highly recommended, as they're superbly comfortable and even more supportive—and a Night package that blacks out big swaths of exterior trim.</p>
<p>Or there's an exterior carbon-fiber package that bundles a front air dam, mirror caps, side-sill inserts, and a rear diffuser, all made from the flashy material.</p>
<p>You can get red-painted brake calipers, inch performance tires with black-painted wheels, and a flat-bottomed steering wheel. For , the AMG model gets some feature upgrades, including keyless ignition and dual-zone climate control as standard equipment. It also gets what Mercedes calls a "next infotainment generation" system with a 7. It also gets some changes to its options packages and performance equipment, and some name changes for the various drive modes.</p>
<p>The CLA has a 5. Also optional, but more elaborate, is the infotainment system that comes as part of the Multimedia package, which uses a 7.</p>
<p>This package also includes a rearview camera and real-time traffic data, but specifying the Multimedia package requires the Premium package be chosen as well. We find COMAND to be frustrating to use while on the road, although perhaps less so when used to set up the car before driving. Both these engines are mated with a seven speed automatic transmission gearbox, which distributes the engine power to its front wheels. Mileage This luxury saloon is available with petrol and diesel engine options.</p>
<p>While it can produce about  On the other hand, its diesel engine is integrated with a globally acclaimed common rail based direct fuel injection system. It can produce a mileage of about 21 Kmpl on the bigger roads and about 16 Kmpl within the city limits, which is rather good for this class. On the other hand, its 2. This engine can produce a maximum power of bhp at rpm and yields a pounding torque output of Nm between to rpm.</p>
<p>However, this cc engine under the hood of AMG version can unleash a peak power of  It is also integrated with a sophisticated anti lock braking system that works with electronic brake force distribution and emergency brake assist system that helps to keep the vehicle agile on slippery roads.</p>
<p>Its AMG version also gets a three-stage electronic stabilization program including curve dynamic assist, which helps the vehicle to be stable by improving the traction.</p>
<p>The automaker has also incorporated a highly responsive steering system based on rack and pinion mechanism. It is also bestowed with a speed-dependent control that provides precise response and reduces the efforts required by the driver. At the same time, its high end versions also have a degree camera that minimizes the efforts required to park this sedan.</p>
<p>It has an advanced security and locking function including programmable key with remote control opening and closing of windows. It also has a tyre pressure monitoring system, impact protection beams, bi-xenon headlamps, ATTENTION Assist function, adaptive brake with hill start assist, central locking system, neck-pro head restraints and anti-theft device.</p>
<p>Wheels Its AMG version is blessed with a sturdy set of inch five-twin spoke alloy wheels as standard. At the same, buyers can opt for multi-spoke style alloy wheels with high-sheen Matte Black finish. While the mid range variants are blessed with a set of inch lightweight alloy wheels. On the other hand, its base version is blessed with a set of inch, spoke design alloy wheels, which are covered with high performance radial tubeless tyres.</p>
<p>The company has also given it a space saving spare wheel, which is affixed in the boot compartment with all other tools required for changing a flat tyre. Figure around 30 miles per gallon on the highway and a mph time of 6. So the CLA is not only efficient, it's still reasonably quick, too. Yes, unlike virtually every other Mercedes-Benz that came to the United States before it, the CLA puts power down through the front wheels. The size overlap is an odd circumstance that will be resolved when a new, slightly larger C-Class arrives in  An all-wheel-drive version of the CLA will be added early next year.</p>
<p>Will Anybody Notice the Difference? After driving a CLA on a combination of tight back roads, crowded city streets and fast highways, we doubt many people will notice that the front wheels are doing all the work. Much of the credit goes to the fact that there's very little tugging at the steering wheel during acceleration. Your feet are raised a bit to rest against the engine wall versus the floor, so it has the feeling of being in a recliner despite the lack of a footrest.</p>
<p>Headroom in back is a bit tighter. With the optional moonroof, my hair was touching the roof. In a model without the moonroof, the CLA gains 1. In this car my hair wasn't touching the ceiling, but I doubt 6-footers will be as lucky.</p>
<p>However, it's unlikely most shoppers will go for the stripped-down model with such feeble technology options. The larger navigation screen itself floats out from the dash almost like an aftermarket kit, but the actual result is much more elegant. The resolution is quite good, with maps as impressive as any on the market.</p>
<p>During our test, each route was preprogrammed into the computer with waypoints, which was convenient. After an unplanned detour, the computer quickly rerouted me back to my hotel. Voice controls also worked well with no need to wait for a prompt or beep to give the next command. It would dial numbers and switch screens between phone and map interfaces with ease.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we didn't have a compatible device to test out the iPod integration, as the connector is still set for previous-generation iPods; an adapter for the connector would be needed. The USB port charged my iPhone 5 but did not play music. Bluetooth audio streaming worked well. Across the lineup, the Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class lineup continues Mercedes tradition in providing a firm, heavy, planted feel—although a tightly-tuned steering, with a nicely weighted feel and quick responses—even if its feedback is minimal.</p>
<p>In recent years, the suspension was made more compliant—a smart move that made the CLA more agreeable for more buyers—while the previously standard Sport mode and upsized inch wheels are an option.</p>
<p>It corners flat and feels no rougher on most surfaces than the cheaper model; some might even describe its ride as more settled. An available AMG sport suspension flattens the roadholding even further.</p></p>
