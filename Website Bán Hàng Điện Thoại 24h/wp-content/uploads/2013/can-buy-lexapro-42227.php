		<p><p>If a doctor seems to be haphazardly Rx'ing meds, then the onus is on the patient to seek out a new doctor. Even at that point, no one will know the outcome Of course there are other ways to approach anxiety, and we discuss them here all the time.</p>
<p>Often times, different methods are successful for different people. Some report great success with meds, others have noghtmarish experiences.</p>
<p>Some do great with just therapy All that really matters is that a person finds relief and a way that works for THEM in dealing with the anxiety. As you can clearly see by the post before yours tara's , making such strong statements being "anti" any form of treatment only does the readers a disservice as it scares an already anxious person into doubting THEIR choices, which is not fair. Most certainly share your experiences, even if they are bad, but please be mindful about making statements indicating that a form of treatment is going to end up horribly for anyone who tries it It's much more effective if you share what you have tried that DOES work for you You can also order online to enjoy our hassle-free delivery service.</p>

All SSRIs, including Lexapro, should not be combined with drugs in the monoamine oxidase MAO inhibitor class of antidepressants such as isocarboxazid Marplan , phenelzine Nardil , tranylcypromine Parnate , selegiline Eldepryl and procarbazine Matulane or other drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase such as linezolid Zyvox and intravenous methylene blue.</p>
<p>Such combinations may lead to confusion , high blood pressure , high fevers, tremor or muscle rigidity, and increased activity.</p>
<p>At least 14 days should elapse after discontinuing Lexapro before starting an MAO inhibitor. Conversely, at least 14 days should elapse after discontinuing an MAO inhibitor before starting Lexapro. Similar reactions occur when SSRIs are combined with other drugs that increase serotonin in the brain, for example tryptophan , St. John's wort , meperidine Demerol , lithium Lithobid , Eskalith , triptans for example, sumatriptan [ Imitrex , Alsuma ] , and tramadol Ultram Use of selective serotonin inhibitors may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients taking warfarin Jantoven , Coumadin , aspirin , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs , and other drugs that cause bleeding.</p>
<p>Is Lexapro escitalopram safe to use during pregnancy or while breastfeeding? The safety of Lexapro during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established. Therefore, Lexapro should not be used during pregnancy unless, in the opinion of the physician, the expected benefits to a patient outweigh unknown hazards to the fetus. Lexapro is excreted in human milk.</p></p>
