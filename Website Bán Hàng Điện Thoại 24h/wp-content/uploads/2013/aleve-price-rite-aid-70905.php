		<p><p>To find out what various retailers were charging, we had secret shoppers check prices for five common generic drugs at stores around the country, including chain drugstores, big-box retailers, supermarkets, and independent pharmacies. What We Uncovered In our national price scan, secret shoppers made more than phone calls in all, to more than pharmacies in six cities and their surrounding areas across the U.</p>
<p>They requested prices for five common generic drugs: Actos pioglitazone , for type 2 diabetes; Cymbalta duloxetine , an antidepressant also used to treat muscle and bone pain; Lipitor atorvastatin , for high cholesterol; Plavix clopidogrel , a blood thinner; and Singulair montelukast , for asthma. What we found was startling. In short, prescription drug prices can vary widely from retailer to retailer, even within the same ZIP code.</p>
<p>Drugs could cost as much as 10 times more at one retailer vs. For example, where Debbie Diljak lives in Raleigh, N. See more examples in the map below. Similar patterns emerged across the U.</p>
<p>For the variety of prices we found, see the chart below. Shoppers sometimes found that they could get a discount, but only after they asked. But none of the newer generics we priced were on the posted list.</p>
<p>Still, those huge discrepancies are puzzling. But our follow-up analysis suggests that many people do pay out of pocket. That gets at the heart of the matter, Schondelmeyer says.</p>
<p>What does concern them is how much third parties, such as insurance companies, will pay, usually either a negotiated reimbursement fee or the list price —whichever is lower.</p>
<p>Costco does that by scrupulously controlling expenses, so you can expect more of a no-frills experience: One big cost savings comes from filling prescriptions at a central facility and shipping them overnight to stores.</p>
<p>So when you phone in a refill, you might be asked whether next-day pick up is okay. Customers can still opt for same-day service. According to Curtis, Costco pharmacies have four times more cash customers than the national average. Because retail pharmacy chains set the list price of drugs so much higher than places like Costco, we also wondered whether they are charging insurance companies more. The situation for consumers could worsen as new marketplace changes occur: And Walgreens has announced its intention to take over Rite Aid.</p>
<p>Our Pricing Analysis Earlier this year, we had secret shoppers make calls to the pharmacies of more than stores across the country to price a market basket of five common generic prescription drugs.</p>
<p>We followed up with half of them recently, and also checked one online pharmacy, to get the most up-to-date prices. The numbers in the chart below are averages of the price retailers quoted for a one-month supply.</p>
<p>Retailers are listed from least to most expensive for the total price of our market basket. Getting the Best Deal With rising drug costs, people whose insurance company stops or reduces coverage of a drug—or those without coverage at all—will feel the pinch.</p>
