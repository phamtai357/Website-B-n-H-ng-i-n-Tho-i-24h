		<p><p>Although a dose adjustment of azithromycin is not recommended when administered in combination with nelfinavir, close monitoring for known adverse reactions of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted.</p>
<p>Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving azithromycin and oral anticoagulants concomitantly. Potential Drug-Drug Interaction with Macrolides Interactions with the following drugs listed below have not been reported in clinical trials with azithromycin; however, no specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate potential drug-drug interaction.</p>
<p>However, drug interactions have been observed with other macrolide products. Until further data are developed regarding drug interactions when digoxin or phenytoin are used with azithromycin careful monitoring of patients is advised. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and mice at doses up to moderately maternally toxic dose levels i. These daily doses in rats and mice, based on body surface area, are estimated to be 3.</p>
<p>In the animal studies, no evidence of harm to the fetus due to azithromycin was found. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Azithromycin has been reported to be excreted in breast milk in small amounts.</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised when azithromycin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use In controlled clinical studies, azithromycin has been administered to pediatric patients ranging in age from 6 months to 12 years.</p>
<p>The safety and efficacy of azithromycin for the prevention or treatment of MAC in HIV-infected children have not been established. Safety data are available for 72 children 5 months to 18 years of age mean 7 years who received azithromycin for treatment of opportunistic infections. Adverse reactions were similar to those observed in the adult population, most of which involved the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment-related reversible hearing impairment in children was observed in 4 subjects 5.</p>
<p>A third child discontinued due to a laboratory abnormality eosinophilia. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients.</p>
<p>These patients were treated for a variety of opportunistic infections, including MAC. The adverse reactions were generally similar to that seen in younger patients, except for a higher incidence of adverse reactions relating to the gastrointestinal system and to reversible impairment of hearing.</p>
<p>In the event of overdosage, general symptomatic and supportive measures are indicated as required. It's important to realize that antibiotic-resistant disease like MRSA is a man-made problem, created by the excessive use of antibiotics. Medical overuse of antibiotics is one aspect, but the greatest, and most hidden, factor is the excessive use of antibiotics in food production.</p>
<p>According to the first-ever report by the US Food and Drug Administration FDA on this subject, American factory farms used a whopping 29 million pounds of antibiotics in alone vi. Back in , a report issued by the Union of Concerned Scientists estimated that the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics in livestock accounted for 70 percent of the total antibiotic use in the US, and when all agricultural uses were considered, they estimated the share could be as high as 84 percent!</p>
<p>It's also likely a primary cause of chronic poor gut health and reduced immune system function! The rise of antibiotic-resistance in livestock is so alarming that government officials have finally admitted you can become infected when you eat or simply handle infected meat.</p>
<p>They also warn that the microbes can contaminate kitchen counters, utensils and other food. Even the USDA, which usually defends agribusiness interests, proclaimed at a congressional hearing that there is indeed a link between antibiotic use in animals and drug resistance in humans viii. In fact, on December 22 last year, the agency quietly posted a notice in the Federal Register that it was effectively reneging on its plan to reduce the use of antibiotics in agricultural animal feed â€” a plan it has been touting since  Against all logic, and with virtually no public announcement, the FDA decided to continue allowing livestock producers to use the drugs in feed.</p>
<p>Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.</p>
