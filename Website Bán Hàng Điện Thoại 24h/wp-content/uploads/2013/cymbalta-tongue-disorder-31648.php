            <h1>Cymbalta tongue disorder</h1>
        </div>
	 
		<p><p>In most patients, the median time to detection of the transaminase elevation was about two months. Syncope and orthostatic hypotension tend to occur within the first week of therapy but can occur at any time during CYMBALTA treatment, particularly after dose increases. The risk of falling appears to be related to the degree of orthostatic decrease in blood pressure as well as other factors that may increase the underlying risk of falls.</p>
<p>In an analysis of patients from all placebo-controlled trials, patients treated with CYMBALTA reported a higher rate of falls compared to patients treated with placebo. Risk appears to be related to the presence of orthostatic decrease in blood pressure.</p>
<p>As elderly patients tend to have a higher underlying risk for falls due to a higher prevalence of risk factors such as use of multiple medications, medical comorbidities and gait disturbances, the impact of increasing age by itself is unclear.</p>
<p>Serotonin Syndrome The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including CYMBALTA, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants , fentanyl, lithium , tramadol, tryptophan , buspirone, amphetamines, and St.</p>
<p>Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes e. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes such as oral tablets or local tissue injection or at lower doses.</p>
<p>If concomitant use of CYMBALTA with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, amphetamines, and St. Treatment with CYMBALTA and any concomitant serotonergic agents, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anti-coagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies case-control and cohort design have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. The reporting rate is generally accepted to be an underestimate due to underreporting. CYMBALTA should be discontinued at the first appearance of blisters, peeling rash, mucosal erosions, or any other sign of hypersensitivity if no other etiology can be identified.</p>
<p>During marketing of other SSRIs and SNRIs serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors , there have been spontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon discontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including the following: Although these events are generally self-limiting, some have been reported to be severe. A gradual reduction in the dose rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible.</p>
<p>If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously prescribed dose may be considered.</p>
<p>No activation of mania or hypomania was reported in DPNP, GAD , fibromyalgia , or chronic musculoskeletal pain placebo-controlled trials. Activation of mania or hypomania has been reported in a small proportion of patients with mood disorders who were treated with other marketed drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder.</p>
<p>Angle-Closure Glaucoma The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including CYMBALTA may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.</p>
<p>There was no significant difference in the frequency of sustained 3 consecutive visits elevated blood pressure. In a clinical pharmacology study designed to evaluate the effects of CYMBALTA on various parameters, including blood pressure at supratherapeutic doses with an accelerated dose titration, there was evidence of increases in supine blood pressure at doses up to mg twice daily.</p>
<p>However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including: This is not a complete list of possible side effects.</p>

<p>An uninterrupted period of illness that includes either a major depressive disorder or a manic episode along with at least two active symptoms of schizophrenia hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, severely disorganized or catatonic behaviors, negative symptoms like decreased emotional expression or movement Delusions for example, paranoia , erotomania, grandiosity, delusional jealousy, persecutory or somatic delusions or hallucinations occur for at least two weeks without major depressive or manic symptoms at some time during the illness.</p>
<p>The symptoms of major mood disorders occur for most of the duration of the illness. The illness is not the result of a medical condition or the effects of alcohol, other drugs of abuse, a medication or exposure to an environmental toxin.</p>
<p>What is the treatment for schizoaffective disorder? Are there home remedies for schizoaffective disorder? Share Your Story Given the potentially serious impact that schizoaffective disorder has on the lives of sufferers, home remedies are not thought to be appropriate to address its symptoms. Treatment for people living with this condition tends to be symptom-based rather than distinctly different based on the illness itself.</p>
<p>In terms of medication treatment, individuals with the bipolar type of the disorder seem to respond best to treatment with an antipsychotic drug combined with a mood-stabilizer drug or treatment with an antipsychotic drug alone.</p>
<p>For people with the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder, combining an antipsychotic medication with an antidepressant medication tends to work best. Since consistent treatment is important for the best outcome, psychoeducation of the person with the illness and their loved ones, as well as using long-acting medications can be important aspects of their care.</p>
<p>For people who don't respond to multiple trials of treatment, electroconvulsive therapy ECT may be an option. Treatment for people who suffer from both schizoaffective disorder and a substance-abuse disorder dual diagnosis tends to be most effective when both conditions are specifically addressed.</p>
<p>Antipsychotic medications have been shown to be effective in treating acute psychosis and reducing the risk of future psychotic episodes. The treatment of schizoaffective disorder thus has two main phases: During the maintenance phase, the medication dosage is gradually reduced to the minimum required to prevent further episodes.</p>
<p>If symptoms reappear on a lower dosage, a temporary increase in medication dosage may help prevent a relapse. Even with continued treatment, some patients have relapses. By far, though, the highest relapse rates are seen when medication is discontinued. Most patients experience substantial improvement when receiving antipsychotic agents.</p>
<p>Some patients, however, do not respond to medications, and a few may seem not to need them. To help you remember, take it at the same time s each day. It is important to continue taking this medication as prescribed even if you feel well. Do not stop taking this medication without consulting your doctor.</p>

Also, you may experience symptoms such as dizziness , confusion, mood swings, headache , tiredness, diarrhea , sleep changes, and brief feelings similar to electric shock. Your dose may need to be gradually decreased to reduce side effects. Report any new or worsening symptoms right away. Tell your doctor if your condition persists or worsens. Side Effects See also Warning section. Nausea , dry mouth , constipation , loss of appetite, tiredness, drowsiness, or increased sweating may occur.</p>
<p>If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor promptly. Dizziness or lightheadedness may occur, especially when you first start or increase your dose of this drug. To reduce the risk of dizziness, lightheadedness, or falling, get up slowly when rising from a sitting or lying position.</p>
