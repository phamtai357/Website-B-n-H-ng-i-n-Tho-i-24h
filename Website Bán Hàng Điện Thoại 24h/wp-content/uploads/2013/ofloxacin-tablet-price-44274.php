		<p><p>Uncomplicated cystitis due to Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Complicated urinary tract infections due to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus 1 or Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1.</p>
<p>Prostatitis due to Escherichia coli. Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify organisms causing the infection and to determine their susceptibility to ofloxacin.</p>
<p>Therapy with ofloxacin may be initiated before results of these tests are known; once results become available, appropriate therapy should be continued. As with other drugs in this class, some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa may develop resistance fairly rapidly during treatment with ofloxacin. Culture and susceptibility testing performed periodically during therapy will provide information not only on the therapeutic effect of the antimicrobial agent but also on the possible emergence of bacterial resistance.</p>
<p>The lesions did not regress after 13 weeks of drug withdrawal. Other quinolones also produce similar erosions in the weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species. Convulsions, increased intracranial pressure, and toxic psychosis have been reported in patients receiving quinolones, including ofloxacin.</p>
<p>Quinolones, including ofloxacin, may also cause central nervous system stimulation which may lead to: These reactions may occur following the first dose. If these reactions occur in patients receiving ofloxacin, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted.</p>
<p>Insomnia may be more common with ofloxacin than some other products in the quinolone class. As with all quinolones, ofloxacin should be used with caution in patients with a known or suspected CNS disorder that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold e.</p>
<p>These reactions often occur following the first dose. This drug should be discontinued immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitative measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines, and airway management, as clinically indicated. Other serious and sometimes fatal events, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported rarely in patients receiving therapy with quinolones, including ofloxacin.</p>
<p>These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea CDAD has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including FLOXIN and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C.</p>
<p>Hypertoxin producing strains of C. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.</p>
<p>Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. Tendon effects Ruptures of the shoulder, hand, Achilles tendon or other tendons that required surgical repair or resulted in prolonged disability have been reported in patients receiving quinolones, including ofloxacin.</p>
<p>Ofloxacin should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain, inflammation, or rupture of a tendon. Patients should rest and refrain from exercise until the diagnosis of tendonitis or tendon rupture has been confidently excluded.</p>
<p>Tendon rupture can occur during or after therapy with quinolones, including ofloxacin. Ofloxacin has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of syphilis. Antimicrobial agents used in high doses for short periods of time to treat gonorrhea may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis. All patients with gonorrhea should have a serologic test for syphilis at the time of diagnosis.</p>
<p>Patients treated with ofloxacin for gonorrhea should have a follow-up serologic test for syphilis after three months and, if positive, treatment with an appropriate antimicrobial should be instituted.</p>
<p>Adequate hydration of patients receiving ofloxacin should be maintained to prevent the formation of a highly concentrated urine. Therefore, excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided. Patients treated with ofloxacin for gonorrhea should have a follow-up serologic test for syphilis after three months and, if positive, treatment with an appropriate antimicrobial should be instituted.</p>
<p>Adequate hydration of patients receiving ofloxacin should be maintained to prevent the formation of a highly concentrated urine.

<p>Torsades de pointes Some quinolones, including ofloxacin, have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram and infrequent cases of arrhythmia. Rare cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during post-marketing surveillance in patients receiving quinolones, including ofloxacin.</p>
<p>Ofloxacin should be avoided in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, patients with uncorrected hypokalemia , and patients receiving Class IA quinidine, procainamide , or Class III amiodarone, sotalol antiarrhythmic agents.

<p>Information for Patients Patients should be advised: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ofloxacin tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections e. When ofloxacin tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed.</p>
<p>Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may 1 decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and 2 increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ofloxacin tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future; that peripheral neuropathies have been associated with ofloxacin use.</p>
<p>The risk of serious tendon disorders is higher in those over 65 years of age, especially those on steroids; that ofloxacin may be associated with hypersensitivity reactions, even following the first dose, to discontinue the drug at the first sign of a skin rash, hives or other skin reactions, a rapid heartbeat, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, any swelling suggesting angioedema e.</p></p>
