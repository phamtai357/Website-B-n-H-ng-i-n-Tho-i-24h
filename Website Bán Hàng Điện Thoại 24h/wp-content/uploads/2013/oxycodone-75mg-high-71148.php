		<p><p>Taking Oxycodone orally or intranasally, had no effect on me. The Dilaudid was much worse physically. Read More Just beacuse someone wants to up there dosage doesnt mean there DR is not on top of there case. You may want to think about why you arent able to take accountability of your addiction and putting the blame onto your DR. Stop putting your ill feelings twords DR's onto other people. This post didnt say anything about a bad DR. Whether this person has one or not, they may. But thats not really for us to decide unless they say so.</p>
<p>Should this occur, use of zopiclone should be discontinued. These reactions are more likely to occur in the elderly. Hypnotics should be avoided in the elderly who are at risk of becoming ataxic and confused and so liable to fall and injure themselves. If, based on clinical need, a decision to treat is nevertheless taken, treatment should be initiated at a lower dose see section 4.</p>
<p>The use of alcohol and other CNS-depressants with zopiclone appears to increase the risk of such behaviours, as does the use of zopiclone at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose.</p>
<p>Discontinuation of zopilcone should be strongly considered for patients who report such behaviours see Section 4. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose- galastose malabsorption should not take this medicine.</p>
<p>The sedative effect of zopiclone may be enhanced when used in combination with alcohol, concomitant use is therefore not recommended. In particular this could affect the patient's ability to drive or use machines. Associations to be taken into account: In combination with CNS depressants an enhancement of the central depressive effect may occur.</p>
<p>Concomitant use of benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-like agents with narcotic analgesics may enhance their euphoric effect and could lead to an increase in psychic dependence. Compounds which inhibit certain hepatic enzymes particularly cytochrome P may enhance the activity of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like agents. The effect of erythromycin on the pharmacokinetics of zopiclone has been studied in 10 healthy subjects.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the hypnotic effect of zopiclone may be enhanced. This may result in an increased risk of adverse effects, particularly in the elderly. Consequently, co-administration of zopiclone with CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided in the elderly see section 4. Conversely, plasma levels of zopiclone may be decreased when co-administered with CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin and St John's wort.</p>
<p>A dose increase for zopiclone may be required when it is co- administered with CYP3A4 inducers. A single dose study has indicated that when zopiclone and carbamazepine are taken in combination, their sedative effects are additive. However, as carbamazepine is a potent inducer of CYP3A4, it is predicted that long-term use of carbamazepine would result in a reduction of zopiclone plasma levels and reduce its hypnotic effects accordingly.</p>
<p>Mutagenesis The combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen has not been evaluated for mutagenicity. Oxycodone alone was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation assay Ames , an in vitro chromosome aberration assay with human lymphocytes without metabolic activation and an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. Oxycodone was clastogenic in the human lymphocyte chromosomal assay in the presence of metabolic activation and in the mouse lymphoma assay with or without metabolic activation.</p>
<p>Fertility Animal studies to evaluate the effects of oxycodone on fertility have not been performed. PERCOCET should not be given to a pregnant woman unless in the judgment of the physician, the potential benefits outweigh the possible hazards. Nonteratogenic Effects Opioids can cross the placental barrier and have the potential to cause neonatal respiratory depression.</p>
<p>Opioid use during pregnancy may result in a physically drug-dependent fetus. After birth, the neonate may suffer severe withdrawal symptoms. Labor and Delivery PERCOCET tablets are not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery due to its potential effects on respiratory function in the newborn.</p>
<p>Acetaminophen is also excreted in breast milk in low concentrations. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Special precaution should be given when determining the dosing amount and frequency of PERCOCET tablets for geriatric patients, since clearance of oxycodone may be slightly reduced in this patient population when compared to younger patients.</p>
<p>Hepatic Impairment In a pharmacokinetic study of oxycodone in patients with end-stage liver disease, oxycodone plasma clearance decreased and the elimination half-life increased. Care should be exercised when oxycodone is used in patients with hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment In a study of patients with end stage renal impairment, mean elimination half-life was prolonged in uremic patients due to increased volume of distribution and reduced clearance. I remedy this with the cold water extraction which despite the contradictory internet opinions, works quite well.</p>
<p>Anyway now to the effects. I usually start feeling something minutes after taking the drug orally. I will feel tightness in my head, like someone is gently pushing on my temples.</p>
<p>It used to annoy me, but now I enjoy it because I know that it just means that the drug is working. Gradually my mood starts improving and a start to get a stupid smile on my face. At around an hour in waves of tingling euphoria start washing through my body. It obviously is different, but somehow very comparable to an orgasm, or at least having sex. I have heard many people describe heroine this way which is why it baffles me that I can get it so easily.</p>
<p>Anyway at this point in the high I get the urge to talk to someone. This usually means that I call me girlfriend and just let her talk about her day, listening to every word like it is necessary for me to live. I smile when I hear her voice and chat about nothing really, but to me in my drug induced state, it seems like the most perfect thing and that I would not want to be doing anything else.</p>
<p>In fact I let it soothe me like I am meditating. Anyway, after I stop talking to my girlfriend which could be half an hour to an hour, depending on her mood I usually listen to music or watch TV.</p>
<p>At about 2 - 2.</p></p>
