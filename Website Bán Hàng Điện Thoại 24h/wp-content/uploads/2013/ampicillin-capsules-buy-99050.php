		<p><p>Ampicillin should be taken with a full glass 8 oz of water, one-half hour before or two hours after meals. Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Ampicillin Capsules and Ampicillin for Oral Suspension should only be used to treat bacterial infections.</p>
<p>They do not treat viral infections e. When Ampicillin Capsules or Ampicillin for Oral Suspension are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that, although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: In streptococcal infections, therapy must be sufficient to eliminate the organism 10 days minimum ; otherwise the sequelae of streptococcal disease may occur.</p>
<p>Cultures should be taken following completion of treatment to determine whether streptococci have been eradicated. Cases of gonococcal infection with a suspected lesion of syphilis should have darkfield examinations ruling out syphilis before receiving ampicillin. Patients who do not have suspected lesions of syphilis and are treated with ampicillin should have a follow-up serologic test for syphilis each month for four months to detect syphilis that may have been masked from treatment for gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Drug Interactions When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with ampicillin: Allopurinol - Increased possibility of skin rash; particularly in hyperuricemic patients may occur. Bacteriostatic antibiotics - Chloramphenicol, erythromycins, sulfonamides, or tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effect of penicillins.</p>
<p>This has been demonstrated in vitro; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well-documented. Oral contraceptives - May be less effective and increased breakthrough bleeding may occur. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, or impairment of fertility in males or females. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category B: Reproduction studies in animals have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to penicillin.</p>
<p>There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, penicillin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Oral ampicillin-class antibiotics are poorly absorbed during labor. Studies in guinea pigs showed that intravenous administration of ampicillin slightly decreased the uterine tone and frequency of contractions, but moderately increased the height and duration of contractions.</p>
<p>However, it is not known whether use of these drugs in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. Nursing Mothers Ampicillin-class antibiotics are excreted in milk.</p>
<p>Ampicillin used by nursing mothers may lead to sensitization of infants; therefore, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue ampicillin, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.</p>
<p>Pediatric use Penicillins are excreted primarily unchanged by the kidney; therefore, the incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants will delay the excretion of penicillin. Adverse Reactions As with other penicillins, it may be expected that untoward reactions will be essentially limited to sensitivity phenomena.</p>
<p>They are more likely to occur in individuals who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to penicillin and in those with a history of allergy, asthma, hay fever or urticaria. The following adverse reactions have been reported as associated with the use of ampicillin: These reactions are usually associated with oral dosage forms of the drug. An erythematous, mildly pruritic, maculopapular skin rash has been reported fairly frequently.</p>
<p>The rash, which usually does not develop within the first week of therapy, may cover the entire body including the soles, palms, and oral mucosa. The eruption usually disappears in three to seven days. Other hypersensitivity reactions that have been reported are: Anaphylaxis is the most serious reaction experienced and has usually been associated with the parenteral dosage form of the drug. Urticaria, other skin rashes, and serum sickness-like reactions may be controlled by antihistamines, and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids.</p>
<p>Whenever such reactions occur, ampicillin should be discontinued unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to ampicillin therapy. Moderate elevation in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase SGOT has been noted, but the significance of this finding is unknown. Hemic and Lymphatic Systems: These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.</p>
<p>Other adverse reactions that have been reported with the use of ampicillin are laryngeal stridor and high fever. An occasional patient may complain of sore mouth or tongue as with any oral penicillin preparation.</p>
<p>Overdosage In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures as required. In patients with renal function impairment, ampicillin-class antibiotics can be removed by hemodialysis but not by peritoneal dialysis. For genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract infections other than gonorrhea in men and women, the usual dose is mg q. For the treatment of gonorrhea in both men and women, a single oral dose of 3.</p>
<p>Physicians are cautioned to use no less than the above recommended dosage for the treatment of gonorrhea. Alternate means of administration are to add the required amount of suspension to formula, milk, fruit juice, water, ginger ale, or cold drinks. These preparations should then be taken immediately. Keep bottle tightly closed. Any unused portion of the reconstituted suspension must be discarded after 14 days. Refrigeration is preferable, but not required. Dosage Forms and Strengths Capsules: Each amoxicillin capsule, with yellow opaque cap and body, contains mg or mg amoxicillin as the trihydrate.</p>
<p>Each film coated tablet contains mg or mg amoxicillin as the trihydrate. The tablets are oval-shaped, unscored and white to yellowish. The mg tablet is embossed GG on one side and on the other side. Each 5 mL of reconstituted suspension contains mg, mg, mg or mg amoxicillin as the trihydrate.</p>
<p>Contraindications Amoxicillin is contraindicated in patients who have experienced a serious hypersensitivity reaction e. Warnings and Precautions Click here to enter text. Anaphylactic Reactions Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients on penicillin therapy including amoxicillin.</p>
<p>Although anaphylaxis is more frequent following parenteral therapy, it has occurred in patients on oral penicillins. There have been reports of individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity who have experienced severe reactions when treated with cephalosporins.</p>
<p>Before initiating therapy with amoxicillin, careful inquiry should be made regarding previous hypersensitivity reactions to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other allergens. Clostridium difficileAssociated Diarrhea Clostridium difficileassociated diarrhea CDAD has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.</p>
<p>Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use.</p>
<p>Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. Potential for Microbial Overgrowth or Bacterial Resistance The possibility of superinfections with fungal or bacterial pathogens should be considered during therapy.</p>
<p>If superinfections occur, amoxicillin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Prescribing amoxicillin either in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient, and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Use in Patients With Mononucleosis A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive amoxicillin develop an erythematous skin rash.</p>
<p>Thus amoxicillin should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. Adverse Reactions The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling: For more information on adverse reactions with clarithromycin or lansoprazole, refer to the Adverse Reactions section of their package inserts. Postmarketing or Other Experience In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during postmarketing use of penicillins.</p>
<p>Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to amoxicillin. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment [see Warnings and Precautions 5. Anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions 5.</p>
<p>Serum sickness—like reactions, erythematous maculopapular rashes, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, and urticaria have been reported. Hepatic dysfunction including cholestatic jaundice, hepatic cholestasis and acute cytolytic hepatitis have been reported.</p>
<p>Crystalluria has been reported [see Overdosage 10 ]. Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.</p>
<p>Tooth discoloration brown, yellow, or gray staining has been reported. Most reports occurred in pediatric patients. Discoloration was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases.</p></p>
