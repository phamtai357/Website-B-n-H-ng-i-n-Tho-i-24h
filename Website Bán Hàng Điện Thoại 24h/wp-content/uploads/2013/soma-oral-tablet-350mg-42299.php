		<p><p>Overdose symptoms in combination with opiates are similar but are distinguished by the presentation of normal or pinpoint pupils , which are generally unresponsive to light.</p>
<p>Carisoprodol as with its metabolite meprobamate is particularly dangerous in combination with alcohol. Flumazenil the benzodiazepine antidote is not effective in the management of carisoprodol overdose as carisoprodol acts at the barbiturate binding site.</p>
<p>Treatment mirrors that of barbiturate overdoses and is generally supportive, including the administration of mechanical respiration and pressors as implicated and in rare cases, bemegride. Total amnesia of the experience is not uncommon following recovery. Pharmacokinetics[ edit ] Carisoprodol has a rapid, minute onset of action, with the aforementioned effects lasting about two to six hours. It is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P oxidase isozyme CYP2C19 , excreted by the kidneys and has about an eight-hour half-life.</p>
<p>A considerable proportion of carisoprodol is metabolized to meprobamate , which is a known drug of abuse and dependence; this could account for the abuse potential of carisoprodol meprobamate levels reach higher peak plasma levels than carisoprodol itself following administration.</p>
<p>Meprobamate is believed to play a significant role in the effects of carisoprodol and meprobamates long half-life results in bioaccumulation following extended periods of carisoprodol administration. It is slightly soluble in water and freely soluble in ethanol , chloroform and acetone. The drug's solubility is practically independent of pH. The drug, originally thought to have antiseptic properties, was found to have central muscle-relaxing properties.</p>
<p>Berger at Wallace Laboratories and was named carisoprodol. Carisoprodol was a modification of meprobamate , intended to have better muscle relaxing properties, less potential for abuse, and less risk of overdose. Monitor closely for evidence of excessive CNS depression. The chlormethiazole labeling states that an appropriately reduced dose should be used if such a combination must be used. Consider therapy modification Chlorphenesin Carbamate: Monitor therapy CNS Depressants: Consider an alternative for one of the interacting drugs.</p>
<p>Some combinations may be specifically contraindicated. Consult appropriate manufacturer labeling. Consider therapy modification Dabrafenib: Seek alternatives to the CYP2C19 substrate when possible. If concomitant therapy cannot be avoided, monitor clinical effects of the substrate closely particularly therapeutic effects.</p>
<p>Consider therapy modification Dimethindene Topical: Consider dose reductions of droperidol or of other CNS agents e. Consider therapy modification Enzalutamide: Conversely, concentrations of active metabolites may be increased for those drugs activated by CYP2C Concurrent use of enzalutamide with CYP2C19 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index should be avoided. Use of enzalutamide and any other CYP2C19 substrate should be performed with caution and close monitoring. Consider therapy modification Flunitrazepam: Avoid concomitant use of hydrocodone and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants when possible.</p>
<p>These agents should only be combined if alternative treatment options are inadequate. If combined, limit the dosages and duration of each drug. Consider therapy modification HydrOXYzine: Monitor therapy Kava Kava: Monitor therapy Magnesium Sulfate: Further CNS depressant dosage adjustments should be initiated only after clinically effective methotrimeprazine dose is established.</p>
<p>Monitor therapy Ombitasvir, Paritaprevir, and Ritonavir: May decrease the serum concentration of Carisoprodol. Monitor therapy Ombitasvir, Paritaprevir, Ritonavir, and Dasabuvir: Monitor therapy Opioid Analgesics: Avoid concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants when possible.</p>
<p>Carisoprodol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. Labor and Delivery There is no information about the effects of Carisoprodol on the mother and the fetus during labor and delivery. Nursing Mothers Very limited data in humans show that Carisoprodol is present in breast milk and may reach concentrations two to four times the maternal plasma concentrations.</p>
<p>However, milk production was inadequate and the baby was supplemented with formula. In lactation studies in mice, female pup survival and pup weight at weaning were decreased. Caution should be exercised when Carisoprodol is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Carisoprodol in pediatric patients less than 16 years of age have not been established.</p>
<p>Geriatric Use The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of Carisoprodol in patients over 65 years old have not been established. Renal Impairment The safety and pharmacokinetics of Carisoprodol in patients with renal impairment have not been evaluated. Since Carisoprodol is excreted by the kidney, caution should be exercised if Carisoprodol is administered to patients with impaired renal function.</p>
<p>Carisoprodol is dialyzable by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hepatic Impairment The safety and pharmacokinetics of Carisoprodol in patients with hepatic impairment have not been evaluated. Since Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver, caution should be exercised if Carisoprodol is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function.</p>
<p>Therefore, caution should be exercised in administration of Carisoprodol to these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology  Carisoprodol has been subject to abuse, misuse, and criminal diversion for nontherapeutic use [see Warnings and Precautions 5. Patients at high risk of Carisoprodol abuse may include those with prolonged use of Carisoprodol, with a history of drug abuse, or those who use Carisoprodol in combination with other abused drugs.</p>
<p>Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its rewarding psychological effects. Drug addiction, which develops after repeated drug abuse, is characterized by a strong desire to take a drug despite harmful consequences, difficulty in controlling its use, giving a higher priority to drug use than to obligations, increased tolerance, and sometimes physical withdrawal.</p>
<p>Drug abuse and drug addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance for example, abuse or addiction may not be accompanied by tolerance or physical dependence [see Drug Abuse and Dependence 9. Physical dependence is characterized by withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Both tolerance and physical dependence have been reported with the prolonged use of Carisoprodol.</p>
<p>Reported withdrawal symptoms with Carisoprodol include insomnia, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, tremors, muscle twitching, anxiety, ataxia, hallucinations, and psychosis.</p></p>
		
		<h2>Carisoprodol, Oral Tablet</h2>
		<p>Pharmacokinetics[ edit ] Carisoprodol has a rapid, minute onset of action, with the aforementioned effects lasting about two to six hours.
