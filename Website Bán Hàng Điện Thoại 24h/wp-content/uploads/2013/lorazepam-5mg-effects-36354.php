		<p><p>The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Warnings Pre-existing depression may emerge or worsen during use of benzodiazepines including Lorazepam. Lorazepam is not recommended for use in patients with a primary depressive disorder or psychosis. Use of benzodiazepines, including Lorazepam, both used alone and in combination with other CNS depressants may lead to potentially fatal respiratory depression. As with all patients on CNS-depressant drugs, patients receiving Lorazepam should be warned not to operate dangerous machinery or motor vehicles and that their tolerance for alcohol and other CNS depressants will be diminished.</p>
<p>Physical and Psychological Dependence The use of benzodiazepines, including Lorazepam, may lead to physical and psychological dependence. The risk of dependence increases with higher doses and longer term use and is further increased in patients with a history of alcoholism or drug abuse or in patients with significant personality disorders.</p>
<p>The dependence potential is reduced when Lorazepam is used at the appropriate dose for short-term treatment. Addiction-prone individuals such as drug addicts or alcoholics should be under careful surveillance when receiving Lorazepam or other psychotropic agents. In general, benzodiazepines should be prescribed for short periods only e.</p>
<p>Extension of the treatment period should not take place without reevaluation of the need for continued therapy. Continuous long-term use of the product is not recommended. Abrupt discontinuation of product should be avoided and a gradual dosage-tapering schedule followed after extended therapy. Abrupt termination of treatment may be accompanied by withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p>There is evidence that tolerance develops to the sedative effects of benzodiazepines. Precautions In patients with depression, a possibility for suicide should be borne in mind; benzodiazepines should not be used in such patients without adequate anti-depressant therapy.</p>
<p>Lorazepam should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function e. COPD, sleep apnea syndrome. Elderly or debilitated patients may be more susceptible to the sedative effects of Lorazepam. Minor Because of the CNS-depressant effects of magnesium sulfate, additive central-depressant effects can occur following concurrent administration with CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised when using these agents concurrently. Moderate Benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants should be combined cautiously with maprotiline because they could cause additive depressant effects and possible respiratory depression or hypotension.</p>
<p>The combination of benzodiazepines and maprotiline is commonly used clinically and is considered to be safe as long as patients are monitored for excessive adverse effects from either agent. Maprotiline may lower the seizure threshold, so when benzodiazepines are used for anticonvulsant effects the patient should be monitored for desired clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>Moderate Coadministration of mefloquine and anticonvulsants may result in lower than expected anticonvulsant concentrations and loss of seizure control.</p>
<p>Monitoring of the anticonvulsant serum concentration is recommended. Dosage adjustments may be required during and after therapy with mefloquine. Major Use caution when combining melatonin with the benzodiazepines; when the benzodiazepine is used for sleep, co-use of melatonin should be avoided. In animal studies, melatonin has been shown to increase benzodiazepine binding to receptor sites.</p>
<p>In one case report, a benzodiazepine-dependent woman with an 11 year history of insomnia weaned and discontinued her benzodiazepine prescription within a few days without rebound insomnia or apparent benzodiazepine withdrawal when melatonin was given. In another case report, the ingestion of excessive melatonin along with normal doses of chlordiazepoxide and an antidepressant resulted in lethargy and short-term amnestic responses. Both cases suggest additive pharmacodynamic effects.</p>
<p>In a clinical trial, there was clear evidence for a transitory pharmacodynamic interaction between melatonin and another hypnotic agent one hour following co-dosing. Concomitant administration resulted in increased impairment of attention, memory and coordination compared to the hypnotic agent alone.</p>
<p>Use of more than one agent for hypnotic purposes may increase the risk for over-sedation, CNS effects, or sleep-related behaviors. Be alert for unusual changes in moods or behaviors. Patients reporting unusual sleep-related behaviors likely should discontinue melatonin use. Moderate Concomitant administration of benzodiazepines with meprobamate can potentiate the CNS effects e. If methadone is initiated in a patient taking a benzodiazepine, reduced dosages are recommended; in opioid-naive adults, use an initial dose of methadone 2.</p>
<p>Moderate Concurrent use of benzodiazepines and other CNS active medications including skeletal muscle relaxants, can potentiate the CNS effects of either agent. Moderate CNS depression can be increased when methscopolamine is combined with other CNS depressants such as any anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics.</p>
<p>Minor Combined use of metoclopramide and other CNS depressants, such as anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics, can increase possible sedation. Other drugs that may also cause drowsiness, such as benzodiazepines, should be used with caution. Moderate The concomitant administration of metyrosine with benzodiazepines can result in additive sedative effects. Moderate Concurrent use of many CNS-active drugs with milnacipran or levomilnacipran has not been evaluated by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Therefore, caution is advisable when combining anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics or other psychoactive medications with these medications.</p>
<p>Minor Injectable minocycline contains magnesium sulfate heptahydrate. Because of the CNS-depressant effects of magnesium sulfate, additive central-depressant effects can occur following concurrent administration with CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines. Moderate Consistent with the pharmacology of mirtazapine and the drug's side effect profile, additive effects may occur with other CNS-active agents, including benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>Moderate Consistent with the pharmacology of molindone, additive effects may occur with other CNS active drugs such as anticonvulsants. In addition, seizures have been reported during the use of molindone, which is of particular significance in patients with a seizure disorder receiving anticonvulsants. Adequate dosages of anticonvulsants should be continued when molindone is added; patients should be monitored for clinical evidence of loss of seizure control or the need for dosage adjustments of either molindone or the anticonvulsant.</p>
<p>MAOIs can cause a variable change in seizure patterns, so careful monitoring of the patient with epilepsy is required when benzodiazepines are used in the treatment of epilepsy. If morphine is initiated in a patient taking a benzodiazepine, reduce initial dosages and titrate to clinical response. For extended-release tablets, start with morphine 15 mg PO every 12 hours, and for extended-release capsules, start with 30 mg PO every 24 hours or less.</p>
<p>Moderate Concomitant use of nabilone with other CNS depressants can potentiate the effects of nabilone on respiratory depression. Minor Nitroglycerin can cause hypotension. This action may be additive with other agents that can cause hypotension such as benzodiazepines. Patients should be monitored more closely for hypotension if nitroglycerin is used concurrently with benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>Moderate Additive CNS depression may occur when oxybutynin is used concomitantly with other CNS-depressant drugs, including anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics. If the extended-release oxymorphone tablets are used concurrently with a CNS depressant, use an initial dosage of 5 mg PO every 12 hours. Moderate Drugs that can cause CNS depression, if used concomitantly with paliperidone, can increase both the frequency and the intensity of adverse effects such as drowsiness, sedation, and dizziness.</p>
<p>Caution should be used when paliperidone is given in combination with other centrally-acting medications including anxiolytics, sedatives, and hypnotics, buprenorphine, butorphanol, dronabinol, THC, ethanol, nabilone, nalbuphine, opiate agonists, and pentazocine. Moderate Concurrent use of papaverine with potent CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines could lead to enhanced sedation. Major A reduction in seizure threshold has been reported following concomitant administration of pemoline with anticonvulsant agents.</p>
<p>Dosage adjustments of anticonvulsants may be necessary during simultaneous use of these drugs. Moderate Patients taking benzodiazepines with perampanel may experience increased CNS depression. Monitor patients for adverse effects; dose adjustment of either drug may be necessary. Moderate Phenothiazines are CNS depressant drugs that may have cumulative effects when administered concurrently and they should be used cautiously with anxiolytic, sedative, and hypnotic type drugs, such as the benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>Caution should be exercised during simultaneous use of these agents due to potential excessive CNS effects or additive hypotension. Additionally, sleep-related behaviors, such as sleep-driving, are more likely to occur during concurrent use of other CNS depressants than with sedatives alone. Monitor for additive effects, unusual moods or behaviors, and warn about the potential effects to driving and other activities.</p>
<p>The CNS depressant effects of topiramate can be potentiated pharmacodynamically by concurrent use of CNS depressant agents such as the benzodiazepines. Concurrent use of topiramate and benzodiazepines associated with thrombocytopenia e.</p>
<p>Moderate Due to the effects of pimozide on cognition, it should be used cautiously with other CNS depressants including benzodiazepines. While more study is needed, benzodiazepine-induced CNS sedation and other adverse effects might be increased in some individuals if DHEA is co-administered. Moderate Pregabalin can potentiate the CNS-depressant action of other drugs such as benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>Moderate Probenecid may inhibit the metabolism of the benzodiazepines, including those which are metabolized by conjugation e. In addition, pretreatment with probenecid shortened the induction time 85 vs. Patients receiving alprazolam therapy should be monitored for signs of altered benzodiazepine response when probenecid is initiated or discontinued. Oral solutions should be refrigerated at 2 C to 8 C 36 F to 46 F.</p>
<p>Injectable solutions should be refrigerated. How does Ativan lorazepam work? Lorazepam is thought that excessive activity of nerves in the brain may cause anxiety and other psychological disorders. Gamma-aminobutyric acid GABA is a neurotransmitter, a chemical that nerves in the brain use to send messages to one another that reduces the activity of nerves in the brain. Discuss with your doctor about slowly decreasing the dose before stopping use of this medication altogether. Do not take lorazepam if you: In some cases, this may be harmful and your doctor may advise you to avoid certain foods.</p>
<p>In the case of lorazepam, there are no specific foods that you must exclude from your diet when receiving lorazepam. Back to Top Before taking lorazepam, tell your doctor about all of your medical conditions. Especially tell your doctor if you: Cigarette smoking may decrease the effectiveness of this medication Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.</p>
<p>Lorazepam and Pregnancy Back to Top Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you have any doubts or concerns you are advised to discuss the medicine with your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>It is sensible to limit use of medication during breastfeeding whenever possible. Do not start, stop, or change the dosage of any medicine before checking with them first. This drug should not be used with the following medications because very serious, possibly fatal interactions may occur: Alcohol Other anxiolytics sodium oxybate.</p>
<p>If you are currently using any of these medications, tell your doctor or pharmacist before starting lorazepam. This information does not contain all possible interactions.</p></p>
