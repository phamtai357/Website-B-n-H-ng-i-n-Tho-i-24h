		<p><p>In conjunction with the dose finding studies in pediatrics described, the pharmacokinetic data for desloratadine orally-disintegrating tablet supports the use of the 2. Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days. No clinically relevant adverse events were reported. In the event of overdose, consider standard measures to remove any unabsorbed drug.</p>
<p>Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended. Desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine are not eliminated by hemodialysis. Although increased plasma concentrations Cmax and AUC hrs of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine were observed, there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine, as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters including the corrected QT interval , clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events.</p>
<p>Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability Cmax and AUC of desloratadine. Protein binding of desloratadine and 3-hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function. Desloratadine a major metabolite of loratadine is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated.</p>
<p>Desloratadine is well absorbed with maximum concentration achieved after approximately 3 hours; the terminal phase half-life is approximately 27 hours. The degree of accumulation of desloratadine was consistent with its half-life approximately 27 hours and a once daily dosing frequency. The bioavailability of desloratadine was dose proportional over the range of 5 mg to 20 mg.</p>
<p>This percentage may vary according to ethnic background. Maximum desloratadine concentration was about 3-fold higher at approximately 7 hours with a terminal phase half-life of approximately 89 hours. The safefy profile of these subjects was not different from that of the general population. There is no evidence of clinically relevant drug accumulation following once daily adult and adolescent dosing of desloratadine 5 mg to 20 mg for 14 days.</p>
<p>In a single dose, crossover study of desloratadine, the tablet and the syrup formulations were found to be bioequivalent. In separate single dose studies, at the recommended doses, paediatric patients had comparable AUC and Cmax Values of desloratadine to those in adults who received a 5 mg dose of desloratadine syrup.</p>
<p>The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and therefore, some interactions with other drugs cannot be fully excluded. Studies conducted show that desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 and desloratadine is not a substrate or an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. In a single dose trial using a 7. In another study, grapefruit juice had no effect on the disposition of desloratadine.</p>
<p>Predinical safety data Desloratadine is the primary active metabolite of loratadine. Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating the burden of seasonal allergic rhinitis as shown by the total score of the rhino-conjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire. The greatest amelioration was seen in the domains of practical problems and daily activities limited by symptoms. Chronic idiopathic urticaria was studied as a clinical model for urticarial conditions, since the underlying pathophysiology is similar, regardless of etiology, and because chronic patients can be more easily recruited prospectively.</p>
<p>Since histamine release is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, desloratadine is expected to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for other urticarial conditions, in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, as advised in clinical guidelines.</p>
<p>In two placebo-controlled six week trials in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in relieving pruritus and decreasing the size and number of hives by the end of the first dosing interval. In each trial, the effects were sustained over the 24 hour dosing interval. As with other antihistamine trials in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who were identified as non- responsive to antihistamines was excluded.</p>
<p>Treatment with Aerius also significantly reduced interference with sleep and daytime function, as measured by a four-point scale used to assess these variables. Desloratadine is well absorbed with maximum concentration achieved after approximately 3 hours; the terminal phase half-life is approximately 27 hours.</p>
