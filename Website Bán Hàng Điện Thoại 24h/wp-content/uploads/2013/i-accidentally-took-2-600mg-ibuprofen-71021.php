		<p><p>Ibuprofen and naproxen can be toxic to dogs and cats, but cats are much more susceptible to this toxicity than dogs are.</p>
<p>A single milligram ibuprofen tablet can be toxic to a cat or small- to medium-sized dog; toxic effects can occur rapidly and damage the kidneys and stomach.</p>
<p>Ibuprofen and naproxen are drugs intended for humans that should not be given to pets. Never administer human medications to your pet unless instructed to do so by your veterinarian, and keep all medications in the home secured to help prevent accidental swallowing by pets.</p>
<p>What Is Ibuprofen and Naproxen Toxicity? Ibuprofen is the active ingredient in medications like Advil and Nuprin. Naproxen is similar to ibuprofen but is longer-acting; it is the active ingredient in medications like Aleve and Naprosyn.</p>
<p>Ibuprofen and naproxen are widely used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation in people. Unfortunately, these drugs can be extremely toxic poisonous to cats and dogs. In clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, ibuprofen tablets have been shown to be comparable to aspirin in controlling pain and inflammation and to be associated with a statistically significant reduction in the milder gastrointestinal side effects see ADVERSE REACTIONS.</p>
<p>Ibuprofen tablets may be well tolerated in some patients who have had gastrointestinal side effects with aspirin, but these patients when treated with ibuprofen tablets should be carefully followed for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding. Gastroscopic studies at varying doses show an increased tendency toward gastric irritation at higher doses. However, at comparable doses, gastric irritation is approximately half that seen with aspirin.</p>
<p>Studies using 51Cr-tagged red cells indicate that fecal blood loss associated with ibuprofen tablets in doses up to mg daily did not exceed the normal range, and was significantly less than that seen in aspirin-treated patients.</p>
<p>Controlled studies have demonstrated that ibuprofen tablets are a more effective analgesic than propoxyphene for the relief of episiotomy pain, pain following dental extraction procedures, and for the relief of the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea. In patients with primary dysmenorrhea, ibuprofen tablets have been shown to reduce elevated levels of prostaglandin activity in the menstrual fluid and to reduce resting and active intrauterine pressure, as well as the frequency of uterine contractions.</p>
<p>The probable mechanism of action is to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis rather than simply to provide analgesia. The ibuprofen in ibuprofen tablets is rapidly absorbed.</p>
<p>Peak serum ibuprofen levels are generally attained one to two hours after administration. With single doses up to mg, a linear relationship exists between amount of drug administered and the integrated area under the serum drug concentration vs time curve. Above mg, however, the area under the curve increases less than proportional to increases in dose. There is no evidence of drug accumulation or enzyme induction.</p>
<p>The administration of ibuprofen tablets either under fasting conditions or immediately before meals yields quite similar serum ibuprofen concentration-time profiles. When ibuprofen tablets are administered immediately after a meal, there is a reduction in the rate of absorption but no appreciable decrease in the extent of absorption. The bioavailability of the drug is minimally altered by the presence of food.</p>
<p>A bioavailability study has shown that there was no interference with the absorption of ibuprofen when ibuprofen tablets were given in conjunction with an antacid containing both aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide. Ibuprofen is rapidly metabolized and eliminated in the urine. The excretion of ibuprofen is virtually complete 24 hours after the last dose. The serum half-life is 1.</p>
<p>Indications and Usage for Ibuprofen mg Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ibuprofen and other treatment options before deciding to use ibuprofen tablets. In Adults ibuprofen is indicated: Contraindications Ibuprofen tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ibuprofen. Ibuprofen tablets should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.</p>
<p>Patients with known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms.</p>
<p>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. Hypertension NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events.</p>
<p>Patients taking thiazides or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs. NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, should be used with caution in patients with hypertension. Ibuprofen should be used with caution in patients with fluid retention or heart failure. Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding, and Perforation NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, can cause serious gastrointestinal GI adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal.</p>
<p>These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in those with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.</p>
<p>Other factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population.</p>
<p>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration.</p>
<p>Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI adverse event is suspected.</p>
<p>Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation.</p>
<p>Perhaps more disturbing is that an acetaminophen overdose can also lead to acute liver damage, which could be deadly. The risk was so concerning that in the FDA asked manufacturers of prescription drugs to limit the amount of acetaminophen to mg per tablet or capsule.</p>
<p>The FDA set the maximum hour dose of acetaminophen at 4, mg. Many believe the daily limit should be lower — 3, mg per day. But keeping within the limits — or even keeping up with how much you are consuming — can be difficult if you are taking more than one acetaminophen-containing product. So, what does that mean for consumers? Know all you can about the medications you are taking.</p></p>
