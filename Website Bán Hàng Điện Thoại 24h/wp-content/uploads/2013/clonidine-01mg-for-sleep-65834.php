            <h1>Abilify (Aripiprazole) is an atypical antipsychotic medication that is used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and in some cases is used as an “add.</h1>

		<p><p>Melatonine, from 2 to 3 mg 1 hr before sleeping, was helpful to falling asleep quickly, but not effective to avoid night wake up or iperactivity. Since 3 weeks we started clonidine 0. Since day 1 he is calm and rests well. Also at school and during the day he's more quiet and calm. He's now in 6th. We've tried so many meds Concerta, Intuniv, Focalic, Metasomethingoranother, and more.</p>
<p>The stimulants caused massive mood swings. And the other stuff just didn't work well either. He's now on Kapvay, the generic form of it, and so far, so good. I have had difficulty getting over them. The Surgeon is really surprised because at this point all his patients in the past have been fully recovered. I was sleeping almost all day. So my Psychiatrist reviewed my meds. She reduced the Abilify.</p>
<p>I have intense muscle weakness and sweating, which she has reassured me will go away. Toe wiggling, and very mild sucking. I am scheduled to go off the rest of Abilify next Tuesday. I will let you know how it goes. I have also done a lot of stints in the psych ward over the last 14 years I think 7. But I have discovered a new tool! It really needs to be taught to you by a professional. My Psychiatrist taught me self hypnosis and also gave me a body scan another very affirming deep relaxation, confidence building exercises these have greatly reduced my anxiety!</p>
<p>I know it sounds wacky but it another tool besides medication to help you stay positive and calm. I wish you the very best. There is always hope. Deena October 25, , 8: First off, this site has been a wonderful find for me. I too am addicted to Abilify. I also gained almost 30 lbs in 2 years. I just started excercising again, very excited about that. The doctor is Mary Ann Block. If anybody reads this and has heard of her, please reply to this and let me know your results and your journey.</p>
<p>Reply Link Karrie September 17, ,  Worth some research for you if you want to change from Abilify to natural meds D.</p>
<p>September 26, , 1: My son has been off abilify for 3 weeks now. He is also taking 5-htp, as well as folic acid with b, GABA and fish oil. He is sleeping a great deal, but in good moods when awake.</p>
<p>Reply Link michelle March 26, , 9: I have gained about 40 lbs. I now feel like I am dying a slow death. I am not depressed or anything but I am so sick to my stomach. Until early middle age I had only a few attempts at meds. Brief with no registered results. Next, upon a renewed attempt to remain abstinent I was suggested Abilify- for bipolar treatment.</p>
<p>Afforded me a chance to see my former self in contrast to my brand-new self. But there was concurrent costs. I slept a lot. Most nights 10 hours. Weekend nights hours. I was easily able to fall asleep. So reading meant sleeping after just a page or two.</p>
<p>Movies — fall asleep. Sexual drive basically zero. But I was serene —  Next, two years and five months later my county mental health center supplied Abilify was abruptly stopped. The county was broke. I finished my supply in nine days. That was July 8 —  Then, first week in September about 7 or eight weeks out I went to hell. Almost to the extent that I considered leaving work daily for first couple months.</p>
<p>Yet day in and day out I walked through this absolute hell. By noon I was escalating sharply. Lessening, yet still bad, in the evening. I fell asleep fine. Probably since exhausted mostly. And the funny thing is that this daily cycling had correlation to the daily hours specified above, and to my being engaged with other people. Back down after the meeting was over and I was alone. I still race up almost always when engaged among people and basically always, when alone fine.</p>
<p>I have never been depressed since Abilify. My story since Abilify is all up, anxious, manic. Never prior to Abilify was I like this. For more than forty years my struggles were house cat sized. Since the end of my 2. I now doubt that I may ever return to pre-Abilfy health level. And I have now, certainly, no interest in ever using Abilify again.</p>
<p>My functionality is just okay. My friends all wonder what happened. I blame my loss of employability to Abilify regardless of any preexistent organic problem I may once have had. I was on Abilify and Effexor for about 5 or more years. I felt much better on them at first but had extreme akathisia for the first few months to a year after I began taking these meds.</p>
<p>I did however begin using alcohol around the same time I started this med combo, and ended up becoming an alcoholic. About 2 years ago my insurance switched me from real Effexor to the generic brand. At that point i started having Effexor withdrawals sometimes even during the days I was taking the med consistently. I have been trying to quit the drinking here and there pretty much ever since I started the drinking.</p>
<p>I have suspected that the med combo Abilify and Effexor was the main cause for my drinking long ago. So about months ago, i decided it was time to get off of these drugs and see if I could finally quit drinking. I thought maybe the meds were hyping me up too much. So i tried to gradually taper off the meds myself. For the first couple of weeks after being completely off of each med, I felt pretty much ok.</p>
<p>I even started drinking less often. But somewhere between then and now I started getting really bad symptoms. I began going through boughs of major depression with suicide ideation, and some of the scariest delusions I have ever had every couple of days or so.</p>
<p>It has been more then 2 months since my last time taking either med. Thank you for reading! If its gonna be bad or not. Reply Link T September 6, ,  I started tapering for 4 days and then quit. My withdrawal has been horrible. I have lethargy, restless legs, diarrhea, decreased appetite, and jittery mostly in mt hands and legs.</p>
<p>My doctor is out of town so I have been at it alone and wondering if I start back at the tapering. Has anyone else had this from such short amount of time? Reply Link Jim G October 25, , 3: Took me two tries, the 2nd was easy but now I am in the sleepy phase — it will pass.</p>
<p>Reply Link tina September 10, ,  Please taper yourself off! Reply Link Leah July 28, , 5: I am having an experience similar to yours. Wanting to go off of Abilify, my Dr. What a train wreck that has been! I was OK for 3 days, then began experiencing the worst nausea of my life. After 3 weeks of living on crackers and Sprite mostly in bed , I finally added back 2. My plan is to stay on 2. This is truly an evil drug! Reply Link Stephanie February 27, , 6: I was prescribed this medication about 4 years ago and when I first started taking the medicine I felt great!</p>
<p>Then after being on it for three years I started getting strange side effects like MS so doctors told me to come off the drug. I am now what I know to be going through awful withdrawals. Insomnia, severe leg cramps, crying hysterically and etc. Reply Link Kristen Mcgill September 6, ,  My psychiatrist took me straight off it because I started in the last 2 months developing facial ticks very badly.</p>
<p>He put me straight on Latdua which I am not too sure about. He asked I go straight to the highest dose which I choose to not do. I want off all meds I have been on for the past 10 years. I have gained over the course of 10 years, 90 lbs and developed diabetes from these meds.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure I am not bipolar either. But back to the withdrawal of Abilify. I have the shakes very badly in the last week. I have been off Abilify for weeks now and my hands are shaking badly and I am so moody. I snap at everyone right now. I am extra sensitive. I am live in Texas and it is hot but I feel like I am in an inferno inside my body.</p>
<p>I have a loss of appetite but still gaining tons of weight. Thank you for this site, I will never again go on a new medication without doing my own research first!!</p>
<p>Reply Link Jessica September 12, , 5: I started taking abilify after getting out of the hospital for suicidal tendencies in December of  I have been on it since. Abilify made me feel like I had no personality. I completely lost myself, and my interest in anything. I had been telling my doctor this for quite sometime, eventually he knocked me down to 5mg from 15mg which was an unnecessary dose in the first place seeing that the 5mg worked just fine.</p>
<p>I stopped taking abilify cold turkey. I was fine for about a week, but for the past few days the only thing I can do is cry. I had my first suicidal thought since being out of the hospital, and self harmed for the first time in about a year. As for me, I am going to make it through this withdrawal period, but this is WAY worse than the withdrawal I went through stopping klonopin cold turkey after taking 2mg everyday for 3 years. Reply Link Cindy September 13, , 4: I was only on abilify for about 3 weeks.</p>
<p>My Dr told me there would be no withdrawal from it and well he was wrong. Just a general yucky feeling I would call it… I wish he had never put me on this drug in the first place. Reply Link confindential September 15, ,  People on here need to realize that 2. To taper correctly you have to get it in liquid form and taper to 0.</p>
<p>And I noticed the difference even from 2. Your psychiatrist can write a prescription to get the pill from a compounding pharmacy to do the correct dosages most compounding pharmacies accept insurance too. My taper schedule is every 4 weeks of 2. But this may need to be adjusted depending on how I feel. My goal is to be off in 6 months if I feel it works.</p>
<p>I was told that 2. Reply Link Philippa September 21, , 8: Any help that anyone can recommend would be wonderful. I want to be doing the same things as other 24 year olds not hide and be scared shake sweat being sick and so on. Reply Link timothy October 17, , 3: It is a partial dopamine agonist, unlike most other antidepressants that mainly target serotonin and can actually lower dopamine production. I have been diagnosed as bipolar and ADHD, which is strongly believed to be caused by an imbalance of the dopamine system.</p>
<p>My doctor suggested I take Abilify as a mood stabilizer instead of lithium. The problem was, he also had me on 80 mg a day of Adderall for ADHD which drastically increases dopamine production. I was rushed to the e. Then put on suicide watch in the psych ward for 2 weeks after I had the panic attack of the century!</p>
<p>I was taken off of everything and slowly started back on my ADHD meds. Plus lithium as a mood stabilizer. I am now completely stable and feel fine. My doctor literally put me into a dopamine induced psychosis! You did jog my memory however with your story. I quickly pulled over. It took a few minutes to pull myself back to reality. These kinds of meds have to have lots of water to function properly in our bodies. First, making blanket statements like "all pharmaceutical companies" or "any doctor" etc, it's ridiculously irresponsible and it takes away from your credibility.</p>
<p>Secondly, the idea that these companies are modern day drug peddlers that want to take their place as "legalized dealers" just to keep people hooked on drugs, is absurd. I wont argue that there is evidence that suggests that some diseases seem to have more money spent on "treatments" than they do on an actual cure, but that is another discussion entirely.</p>
<p>And, in regards to the statements about doctors intentionally putting patients onto a drug that is "every bit as addictive, but give none of the pleasure" should demonstrate its' own absurdity if you read the sentence more than once. The whole idea is to decrease its potential for abuse. The HEPA operates by physically saddlery particles that experience the permeate.
