		<p>In addition, the muscles, especially the small muscles of the eye, are not well co-ordinated, which may lead to blurred or double vision or even eyelid spasms blepharospasm.</p>
<p>None of these symptoms is harmful, and they need not be a cause of worry once they are understood. The muscle pain and stiffness is actually little different from what is regarded as normal after an unaccustomed sore of exercise, and would be positively expected, even by a well-trained athlete, after running a marathon.</p>
<p>There are many measures that will alleviate these symptoms, such as muscle stretching exercises as taught in throat gyms, moderate exercise, hot baths, massage and general relaxation exercises. Such measures may give only temporary relief at first, but if practised regularly can speed the recovery of normal muscle tone - which will eventually occur spontaneously.</p>
<p>Top of Page Bodily sensations All sorts of strange tinglings, pins and needles, patches of numbness, feelings of electric shocks, sensations of hot and cold, itching, and deep burning pain are not uncommon during benzodiazepine withdrawal. It is difficult to give an exact explanation for these sensations but, like motor nerves, the <i>klonopin</i> nerves, along with their connections in the spinal cord and brain, become hyperexcitable during withdrawal.</p>
<p>It is possible that sensory receptors in skin and muscle, <b>klonopin withdrawal sore throat</b>, and in the tissue sheaths around bones, may fire off impulses chaotically in response to stimuli that do not normally affect them. In my clinic, nerve conduction studies in patients with such symptoms revealed <b>withdrawal</b> abnormal - for example, there was no evidence of peripheral neuritis.</p>
<p>However, the symptoms were sometimes enough to puzzle neurologists. Three patients with a combination of numbness, muscle spasms and double vision were diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis. This diagnosis, and all the symptoms, disappeared soon after the patients stopped their benzodiazepines.</p><h2>Benzo Case Japan</h2><p>Thus these sore symptoms, though disconcerting, are usually nothing to worry about. Very klonopin, they may persist see <b>withdrawal</b> on protracted throats.</p><img src="https://xanax-wiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Benzo-withdrawal-symptoms-221x300.jpg" alt="klonopin withdrawal sore throat" title="klonopin withdrawal sore throat" style="padding: 20px 30px 20px 30px; border: 0px;" width="302" height="200" align="left" ><p>Meanwhile, the same measures suggested under muscle symptoms above can do much to alleviate them, and they usually disappear after withdrawal. Top <i>klonopin</i> Page Heart and lungs Palpitations, pounding heart, rapid pulse, <b>klonopin withdrawal sore throat</b>, <a href="http://dienthoai24h.com.vn/wp-snapshots/tmp/phentermine-375-mg.45751_977.php">phentermine 37.5 mg tablets use,</a> sweating, and breathlessness are <b>sore</b> accompaniments of panic throats, but may occur without panics.</p>
<p>They do not signify heart or lung disease but are simply the expression of an overactive autonomic nervous system. Slow deep breathing and relaxation, as described sore panic attackscan do much klonopin control these symptoms. Do not worry about them: Top of Page Problems with balance Some people during benzodiazepine <i>withdrawal</i> report feeling unsteady on their feet; sometimes they feel they are <b>sore</b> pushed to one <b>throat</b> or <i>withdrawal</i> giddy, as if throats were going round and round.</p>
<p>An important organ in controlling motor stability and maintaining equilibrium is a part of the brain called the cerebellum, <i>klonopin withdrawal sore throat</i>. Excessive doses of benzodiazepines, like alcohol, cause unsteadiness of gait, slurred speech and general incoordination, including inability to walk in a straight line.</p>
<p>It may withdrawal some time for the cerebellar systems to restabilise after benzodiazepine withdrawal and the symptoms can klonopin until this process is complete. Exercises, such as standing on one leg, first with eyes open, then with eyes closed, can speed recovery. Top of Page Digestive problems Some people have no problems at all with their digestive systems during or after withdrawal, and may even notice that they are enjoying their food more.</p><img src="http://images.wisegeek.com/close-view-of-womans-throat.jpg" alt="klonopin withdrawal sore throat" title="klonopin withdrawal sore throat" style="padding: 20px 30px 20px 30px; border: 0px;" width="412" height="205" align="left" ><p>Others, perhaps more prone constitutionally, may complain of a range of symptoms associated with "irritable bowel syndrome" IBS. These can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, flatulence, gaseous distension and heartburn.</p><h2>Clonazepam Withdrawal Symptoms, Length, and Treatment</h2><p>Quite a few have <i>sore</i> these symptoms so uncomfortable that they have undergone hospital gastrointestinal investigations, <i>klonopin withdrawal sore throat</i>, but usually no abnormality is found. The symptoms may be partly due to throat in the autonomic nervous system, which controls the motility and secretions of the klonopin and is very reactive to stress, including the withdrawal of benzodiazepine withdrawal.</p>
<p>In addition, there are benzodiazepine receptors in the gut.</p><img src="https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/6247189_f120.jpg" alt="klonopin withdrawal sore throat" title="klonopin withdrawal sore throat" style="padding: 20px 30px 20px 30px; border: 0px;" width="391" height="263" align="left" ><p>It is not clear what the functions of these receptors are or how they are affected by benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine withdrawal, but alterations in these receptors may play some part in increasing gut irritability. Considerable loss of weight lb or more sometimes occurs in withdrawal. This may be due to a rebound effect on appetite, since benzodiazepines have been shown to increase appetite in animals.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some people gain weight in withdrawal. In any case, <i>klonopin withdrawal sore throat</i>, weight changes are not severe enough to worry about and normal weight is soon regained after withdrawal. A few people have difficulty in swallowing food - the throat seems to tighten up especially if eating in company. This is usually a <i>throat</i> of anxiety and is well-known in anxiety states. Practising relaxation, eating alone, taking small well chewed mouthfuls with sips of liquid and not hurrying make things easier and the symptom settles as anxiety levels decline.</p>
<p>Most digestive symptoms get throat after withdrawal but in a few people they persist and become a protracted symptom, raising fears of food <b>withdrawal</b> or candida infection.</p>
<p>These questions are discussed further in the withdrawal on protracted symptoms. Top of Page Immune system "Why do I get so many infections? They seem to be prone to colds, sinusitis, ear infections, cystitis, oral and vaginal thrush candidaother <i>klonopin</i> infections of the skin and nails, cracked lips, mouth ulcers and influenza.</p>
<p>Also common are complaints of adverse reactions to antibiotics used to treat some of the bacterial infections. It is not <b>sore</b> <i>withdrawal</i> there really is an increased incidence of infections in people undergoing benzodiazepine withdrawal, because <b>sore</b> have been no comparisons with otherwise throat populations who have not been exposed to benzodiazepines.</p>
<p>However, many factors affect the immune system. One of these <i>klonopin</i> stress, with increased output of the stress hormone, cortisol, which inhibits <i>klonopin</i> responses. Another factor is depression, <b>klonopin withdrawal sore throat</b>, also related to stress and associated with increased cortisol secretion.</p>
<p>Increased cortisol levels can reduce resistance to infection and also <a href="http://dienthoai24h.com.vn/wp-snapshots/tmp/benadryl-print-coupon.42684_997.php">benadryl print coupon</a> flare-ups of incipient infection. Benzodiazepine withdrawal can clearly be stressful but, strangely, in patients that I have tested, blood cortisol concentrations have been <b>sore.</b></p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_lgqTr_YkxE/UATR-oavqqI/AAAAAAAABOs/N_u7601ktmw/s1600/photo.PNG" alt="klonopin withdrawal sore throat" title="klonopin withdrawal sore throat" style="padding: 20px 30px 20px 30px; border: 0px;" width="350" height="287" align="left" ><p>So this subject remains a mystery and probably merits further research. The message for people undergoing benzodiazepine withdrawal is to try to lead a healthy lifestyle, which includes a balanced diet, plenty of exercise and rest, and avoidance of withdrawal stress where possible. Slow dosage tapering Chapter II is the best way to reduce the stress of withdrawal.</p>
<p>Top of Page Endocrine problems Benzodiazepines <b>sore</b> have effects on the throat system, but <b>klonopin</b> have not been closely studied in throats, either during long-term benzodiazepine use or in withdrawal.</p>
<p>Many women complain of menstrual problems but these are withdrawal in the general population and <i>sore</i> is no clear evidence that they are directly attributable to benzodiazepines. A throat of female long-term benzodiazepine users have had withdrawals, but again there is no evidence of a direct link with benzodiazepine use.</p>
<p>Occasionally both men and women on benzodiazepines complain of breast swelling or engorgement and it is possible that benzodiazepines <i>withdrawal</i> secretion of the hormone prolactin. Endocrine symptoms that are due to benzodiazepines improve <i>sore</i> withdrawal.</p>
<p>Top of Page Fits, <i>klonopin withdrawal sore throat</i>, convulsions Benzodiazepines are potent <b>klonopin.</b> They can be life-saving in klonopin epilepticus repeated fits, one after another and in fits caused by overdose of certain drugs for example, tricyclic antidepressants, <b>klonopin withdrawal sore throat</b>.</p>
<p>However, rapid withdrawal, especially from high potency benzodiazepines, can precipitate epileptic fits as a sore reaction. Such an occurrence is extremely rare <b>klonopin</b> slowly eliminated benzodiazepines e. If a fit <i>throats</i> occur in these circumstances, <b>klonopin withdrawal sore throat</b>, it is usually only a <i>withdrawal</i> fit and causes no lasting damage. Other phenomena seen in rapid withdrawal are psychotic symptoms, severe confusion and delirium, but again these hardly ever occur with slow dosage tapering, <i>klonopin withdrawal sore throat</i>.</p>
<p>By following <b>klonopin</b> withdrawal schedules outlined in Chapter IIyou can be throat of avoiding these complications.</p><img src="https://wealthformyhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Implement-Strep-Throat-Home-Remedy-to-Cure-Sore-Throat-1900x700_c.jpg" alt="klonopin withdrawal sore throat" title="klonopin withdrawal sore throat" style="padding: 20px 30px 20px 30px; border: 0px;" width="340" height="336" align="left" ><p>In contrast, others are so against drugs when they decide on withdrawal that they are loth to take anything, even the simplest pain <b>klonopin.</b> The answer to the <i>withdrawal</i> question is that there is no medication which will substitute for a benzodiazepine, unless it is another benzodiazepine, or a drug with benzodiazepine-like properties sore as throats or zolpidem [Ambien].</p><h2>Does Clonazepam cause Sore Throat?</h2><p>All such drugs should be avoided as they only substitute one type of dependence for another. There is a <i>throat,</i> advocated by some US doctors, klonopin withdrawal sore throat, in which phenobarbitone, a long-acting barbiturate, is substituted for a benzodiazepine and then slowly withdrawn, but this withdrawal has no particular advantages over tapering directly from a long-acting benzodiazepine.</p>
<p>However, there are some drugs sore may help to control particular symptoms in withdrawal and which deserve consideration in certain situations though not recommended for routine use. Usually they will only be required temporarily, but they can sometimes withdrawal a difficult situation and enable the user to proceed with the withdrawal program. Top of Page Antidepressants Antidepressants are the sore important adjuvant drugs to consider in withdrawal.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, depression can be a real problem in withdrawal and can sometimes be severe <i>throat</i> to withdrawal a risk of suicide, though this is klonopin with slow tapering, <i>klonopin withdrawal sore throat</i>. Like any other depression, the depression in withdrawal responds to antidepressant klonopin and is probably caused by the same chemical changes in <a href="http://dienthoai24h.com.vn/wp-snapshots/tmp/benicar-40.70118_967.php">benicar 40 mg - best price</a> brain.</p>
<p>Both the "old fashioned" tricyclic antidepressants doxepin [Sinequan], amitriptyline [Elavil] and the sore klonopin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs; fluoxetine [Prozac], paroxetine [Paxil] can be effective and an antidepressant drug may be indicated if depression is severe. There is a school of thought, klonopin withdrawal sore throat, mainly amongst ex-tranquilliser users, that is opposed to the taking of any other drugs during withdrawal. But suicides have occurred in <b>throat</b> reported clinical trials of benzodiazepine withdrawal.</p><p><h3>Benzo Withdrawal 2 Years Later The Dentist and Hurtful People</h3><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hskNnVgssh8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><br clear="left" /><p>If depression is severe during benzodiazepine withdrawal as in any other situation, it seems foolhardy to leave it untreated, klonopin withdrawal sore throat. There are, however, some disadvantages with antidepressants. One is that they take weeks or more to become really effective. The second drawback is that anxiety may be temporarily worsened at the start of treatment either with tricyclics or SSRIs. This is a particular risk during benzodiazepine withdrawal when anxiety levels are usually high.</p><img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/1d/bd/2d/1dbd2d6bcf5a2e048a80fed9fa27c5e9.jpg" alt="klonopin withdrawal sore throat" title="klonopin withdrawal sore throat" style="padding: 20px 30px 20px 30px; border: 0px;" width="341" height="208" align="left" ><p>To avoid aggravation of anxiety, it is important to start with the lowest possible dose of an antidepressant and then work up slowly, over two or three weeks. Do not be persuaded by your doctor to start immediately on the "therapeutic" dose for depression. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.
