<title>Can you take xanax with subutex :: So yes, you can get high from subutex, thats why most doc's prescribe suboxone instead of subutex. And as with any opiate, mixing xanax or other benzo's greatly enhances the opiate's effect. Often opiate addicts will begin doing this once their opiate tolerance is so great that they no longer get high, but rather just take the opiate's to not be sick.</title>
