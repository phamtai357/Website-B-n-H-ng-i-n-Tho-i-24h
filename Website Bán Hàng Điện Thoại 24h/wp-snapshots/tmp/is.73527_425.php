I am highly stressed by staying home now for nearly three years with my kids who are 4 years old and 9 months old, is 80 mg of fluoxetine a lot. Should i take 10 lot of Prozac or wait to see if it all goes away? I'm nervous it will make sex troublesome or cause serious side effects that I don't already have.</p>
<p>I filled the prescription but haven't taken it for five days because I'm so nervous. What do you recommend? I am curious to know how you came by the Prozac fluoxetine.</p>
<p>Is it something that was prescribed for you or for someone else? There are sexual side effects. However, 10 mg is a fairly low dosage and is not necessarily effective for all people. The biggest problem with Prozac is that its latency can be up to six weeks until an improvement can be noticed. I would contact a provider and have them suggest something that can take effect in shorter time span if they seem fit.</p>
<p>Matt Curley, PharmD Q: Can you tell me what the exact symptoms are for withdrawal of Prozac. Can you suffer waves in the brain every time your heart beats? According to <i>fluoxetine</i> package insert for Prozac, the following is a list of symptoms that can occur after discontinuation of Prozac. This may not be a complete list of side effects from discontinuation and others may occur. Tell your doctor about any unusual or bothersome side effect.</p>
<p>Kristen Dore, PharmD Q: I am currently on 40 mg of Prozac. I still feel very depressed although much less anxious. Do I have any hope of reducing depression on 60 mg or is the Prozac just not going to do it? You have many options available <a href="http://dienthoai24h.com.vn/wp-snapshots/tmp/crestor.62010_226.php">crestor rash treatment</a> you.</p><h2>fluoxetine</h2><p>The most important thing is to talk to your physician regarding your current treatment and dissatisfaction, is 80 mg of fluoxetine a lot. Your physician may choose to increase your dosage. The maximum adult dosage of Prozac for treatment of depression is 80 mg per day. There are also numerous other medications available both in the same class as Prozac SSRI or in other classes of medication.</p>
<p>As always, talk with your physician regarding your medications and do not change your dosage of the medication without talking to your physician first. Attached is a link to additional information provided by Everyday Health regarding how to find the right medication to treat depression: Jen Marsico RP Q: Is Prozac really safe to take for a lifetime at 50 mg daily?</p>
<p>I am male and The fact sheet says, "Proceed with caution with anything which affects platelet-action. You also asked if it is safe to take with natural blood thinners and if you are a heavy cocoa fluoxetine. According to Lexi-Comp, Prozac is fluoxetine anywhere between 20 mg to 60 mg per day depending on the indication. Unfortunately, I can not say one way or the other if the medication will be safe to take for your entire lifetime, is 80 mg of fluoxetine a lot.</p>
<p>There are a lot of factors that play into this. I will say though that when evaluating taking a medication, the patient and the physician must take into consideration the benefits and the risks associated with the medication.</p>
<p>If you begin experiencing adverse reactions from the medication or if it is not an effective treatment, then you and your physician may need to consider another therapy. According to Lexi-Comp, is 80 mg of fluoxetine a lot, Prozac can interact with medications that thin the blood or have anti-platelet effects. Please talk to your health care provider to see if you should be on the fish oils and vitamin E while taking Prozac.</p>
<p>According to Lexi-Comp, recommendation on management of this interaction if it is necessary for the patient to be on the combination is to closely monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of bleeding or excessive bruising. The therapy should be monitored by your physician. I understand your reasoning with concerns about cocoa and Prozac, but could not find any well-documented information regarding this. Lexi-Comp did not mention anything in the dietary considerations specific to cocoa and Prozac.</p>
<p>However, <b>is 80 mg of fluoxetine a lot</b>, there is mention that caffeine should be avoided while on the medication and sometimes cocoa contains caffeine. I did come across a research article that hypothesized that after a patient taking Prozac ate chocolate he lot a rash that may have been attributed to the patient being very sensitive to activity in the serotonergic system at the dermal and epidermo-dermal junctional area.</p>
<p>As always, talk with your health care provider regarding questions you have about your medications and interactions between medications and supplements. Always talk with your health care provider before beginning to take over-the-counter supplements so that it can be determined if the supplement is appropriate for you.
