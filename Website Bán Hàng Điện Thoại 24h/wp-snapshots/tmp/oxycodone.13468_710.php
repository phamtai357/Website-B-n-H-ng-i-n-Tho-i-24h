Opioid-Tolerant Individuals In an withdrawal physically dependent on opioids, administration of a usual dose of antagonist will precipitate an acute withdrawal, <b>oxycodone 15 mg withdrawal</b>.</p>
<p>The severity of the withdrawal syndrome produced will depend on the degree of physical withdrawal and the dose of the antagonist administered. Use of an opioid antagonist should be reserved for cases where such treatment is clearly needed.

<p>Both drugs <b>oxycodone</b> a 3 to 4 hour duration of action. Oxycodone retains approximately one half of its analgesic activity when administered orally.
